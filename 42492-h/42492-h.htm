<span class="f8">A CONVERSATION UPON THE PAST, THE
PRESENT, AND THE FUTURE.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Now</span>, doctor, you know my secret, and the
whole of it,&rdquo; said Zabra, at the conclusion of
a long and interesting narrative he had communicated
to Dr. Tourniquet, upon one of his
professional visits. &ldquo;Let not a word pass from
your lips concerning what I have told you, for
it would do me irreparable mischief. Be in
your behaviour to me exactly as you have been.
The slightest alteration would create suspicion,
and that I am most anxious to avoid. May I
rely upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rely upon me!&rdquo; cried the surgeon, while
his good-natured countenance was glowing with
benevolence. &ldquo;If you ever catch me saying a
word, I&rsquo;ll allow any body to make a preparation
of me before I&rsquo;m dead. I&rsquo;d sooner demonstrate
upon my own skeleton, don&rsquo;t you see, than
betray your secret. By all that&rsquo;s good, you&rsquo;re
an extraordinary creature&mdash;a more extraordinary
creature than ever I met with in the whole
course of my practice. I always thought there
was something strange about you, don&rsquo;t you
see&mdash;a mystery I could not exactly understand&mdash;but
now every thing appears as simple as the
first rudiments of medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gratify me exceedingly by this assurance,&rdquo;
observed the youth, &ldquo;and I am delighted
by your ready acquiescence with my wishes.
How can I best express my gratitude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush, tush&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk about that,&rdquo; replied
the other kindly. &ldquo;Knowing what I do
of you, I would do any thing in the world to
serve you, don&rsquo;t you see. Consider me from
this time as your father, your brother, or your
friend, and whenever my advice or assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
can be useful, apply to me, and I will do all in
my power to forward your interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You overpower me with your goodness,&rdquo;
said his young companion, returning the cordial
pressure of the hand he had received. &ldquo;Can I
ever repay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush, tush, never mind repaying,&rdquo; hastily
rejoined the doctor. &ldquo;I am well repaid by the
pleasure it gives me to assist in your noble intentions,
don&rsquo;t you see. But if I may be
allowed to give you a little advice, I should
strongly recommend you not to be so careless
of your life as you have been. You are not
formed for fighting, don&rsquo;t you see. You are
not strong enough; but notwithstanding that,
to my certain knowledge you paid off many of
the piratical rascals pretty handsomely, and
showed them to what profit you could apply the
lessons they had given you. When I think of
you finishing some of the scoundrels so dexterously
as you did, I am filled with wonder.
However, it is not right. You stand no chance
in the midst of a set of strong ferocious men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
intent upon destroying all who oppose them.
Your escape is a miracle; but you should remember
that you cannot be spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, doctor!&rdquo; replied his patient, with a
languid smile, &ldquo;what made you join in the
conflict? Consider if <em>you</em> had been killed, what
would have become of the wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; responded Tourniquet; &ldquo;I
never gave that a thought. But I had no time
to think. I saw every one preparing to fight,
and I knew we should all be massacred if we
didn&rsquo;t succeed. Although it was a sort of trade
to which I was quite unused, the examples I
saw before me made me valiant, and when I
got fairly into the fray, I found myself obliged
to cut away as hard as I could, don&rsquo;t you see.
Fortyfolios, too, didn&rsquo;t do amiss. It&rsquo;s wonderful
how the prospect of being cut to pieces, if one
don&rsquo;t fight, <em>makes</em> a fellow fight. The professor
went at it as if he was at one of his old
arguments; and I must say this for him, he
convinced his opponents then much more perfectly
than he does in his verbal disputes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not hurt, I hope?&rdquo; inquired Zabra
earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he had a narrow escape,&rdquo; replied
the doctor. &ldquo;A ball grazed his ear, and a
cutlass has scratched his ribs. I should have
been sorry if either had taken the effect intended;
for although he is somewhat dogmatical
and intemperate in his manner of arguing, he possesses
no ordinary share of learning, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are the rest of the wounded getting
on?&rdquo; asked his patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Famously,&rdquo; said the surgeon cheerfully;
&ldquo;I think they are all doing well. I may add,
as well as it is possible for them to do. Two
or three of them have been severely used; on
one I shall be obliged to perform an operation.
Climberkin&rsquo;s wounds are beginning to heal;
Ardent has returned to his duty. Many have
received but trifling hurts, and Hearty, Boggle,
and Master Porphyry have escaped without a
scratch. This is rather surprising, considering
that the old man Hearty&mdash;Captain Hearty we
must call him now, I suppose&mdash;fine old fellow!
hacked his way through the pirates with a cool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
steady, determined courage that nothing could
withstand; and as for Oriel Porphyry, he fought
like a hero. I never saw such a change in any
man, don&rsquo;t you see. He looked as if he&rsquo;d
been born a conqueror, and for the first time
in his life had ventured into his right element.
There was such a fire in his eyes, and such a
grandeur in his appearance. It was extraordinary.
His very looks seemed to kill; none
could resist him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he not a noble creature?&rdquo; said Zabra,
his eyes again glowing with all their accustomed
animation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed he is,&rdquo; replied Dr. Tourniquet, with
emphasis: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at your enthusiasm,
don&rsquo;t you see. I shall begin to look upon him
with a similar admiration myself. I never could
have supposed that the mere appearance of
daring valour was so grand and imposing; but
there is something of the cause of this in his
tall manly figure, and handsome countenance,
don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! there is his footstep,&rdquo; exclaimed
the youth earnestly, as he arranged with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
unwounded arm the bed-clothes closely around
him. &ldquo;This place is too dark for him to see
very accurately, which is what I require. There!
be feeling my pulse when he enters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he now, doctor,&rdquo; inquired Oriel
Porphyry, advancing towards the hammock
near which the surgeon stood, seemingly intent
upon his professional duties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His pulse is getting more firm,&rdquo; said Dr.
Tourniquet, assuming an air of great seriousness,
&ldquo;and his wound is suppurating healthily.
He cannot be doing better. But you must
apply to the patient for further information, as
I am obliged to go my rounds, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;
So saying, the doctor departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you better, Zabra?&rdquo; affectionately
asked Master Porphyry, seating himself by the
hammock of his wounded friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better, Oriel,&rdquo; replied the youth, as
he held out his hand to clasp that of his patron.
The merchant&rsquo;s son felt that the small hand
within his own was dry and hot, and that the
flesh had lost much of the roundness by which
it had previously been distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your skin feels feverish,&rdquo; remarked his
companion. &ldquo;But not so much so, I think, as
it was yesterday; and your eyes look more
brilliant. I shall be delighted when you recover,
not only because I miss the rich melody of your
voice, and the stirring eloquence of your conversation,
but because I know the confinement
and inaction consequent upon this indisposition
can scarcely be endurable to such a nature as
yours. But when you do recover, which I
hope will be speedily, I will take care you shall
not again run into such risks. Who could have
supposed that you were planning such an admirable
scheme! I had not the slightest idea
of such a thing. Far from it, I thought, and I
blame myself exceedingly for having entertained
a suspicion to your prejudice, that you had
some sinister intention in your behaviour to the
pirates. It is only an act of justice on my part
to acknowledge that I have thought unworthily
of you, without a cause; but I am too well
aware that such an avowal forms an inadequate
reparation, you must therefore allow me to express
my regrets for the injury I have done you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in a manner more in accordance with my own
sense of right. I am indebted to you not only
for life and liberty, but for all that render them
in my case more than usually endurable; for
this I can never be sufficiently grateful: and
when my father comes to know, as know he
soon shall, how much you assisted in rescuing
his ship from the pirates, and his son from their
weapons, I am quite sure that he will rather
seek to increase than diminish the measure by
which I would show the extent of the obligation
you have rendered. But, besides this, I have
a natural affection for you, which has been
created by a knowledge of your amiable disposition
and noble character; and I should wish
you always to be with me, that I might as much
as possible profit by the example of your good
qualities; therefore you must submit to the
necessity of sharing my fortune, and of becoming
in every respect the equal of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cannot be, Oriel,&rdquo; said the other
mildly. &ldquo;Allow me still the same opportunities
I have enjoyed of watching over your safety;
and if, through my care and attention you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
enabled to return unharmed to Eureka, and
your sentiments in my favour remain the same,
and she shows no disinclination to their indulgence,
I will offer no further opposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very strange of you,&rdquo; remarked
Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;Very strange: I cannot
account for it, except I imagine that there is a
sort of pride in your nature that cannot accommodate
itself to any thing in the shape of favours
from another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; replied the youth languidly.
&ldquo;Indeed, it is not that. Your kindness has
made upon me so deep an impression, and your
friendship has become so intimately commingled
with all my sympathies, that now I should find
it a difficult matter to exist without them. But
there are causes which I cannot explain, that
prevent my accepting your generous proposals,
independently of which there is nothing in what
I have done that deserves such a return. Remember
that my duty here is to endeavour to
preserve you from every danger by which you
may be threatened. I have accepted an office,
and I am bound to fulfil its duties. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
part I played to effect your escape out of the
power of those wretches, I only performed
what I had engaged myself to do; and although
my efforts to deceive your captors were repugnant
to my feelings, I continued the deception
because I saw that there was no way
of effecting your liberation, but by practising
deceit. Again, I assure you, that Eureka will
amply reward me (if a reward be necessary)
for any service I may be so fortunate as to be
able to render you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why am not I to be allowed to acknowledge
the obligation according to my own sense
of your merit?&rdquo; asked his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is Eureka&rsquo;s chief pleasure,&rdquo; replied
Zabra, with a faltering voice, &ldquo;to reward
after her own fashion those whom she
employs to serve him to whom she is devoted;
and surely you would not wish to deprive her
of a gratification to the enjoyment of which
she puts forth, as you acknowledge, so good a
title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I must reserve my gratitude
for her then, I suppose,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
&ldquo;But, of course, you will remain with me as
you have hitherto done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till there shall be no longer any occasion
for my stay,&rdquo; responded the other. &ldquo;While
you love Eureka, there will always appear to
me to be a necessity for my remaining with
you; but when your love for her disappears,
there will be no longer occasion for my presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love her I always shall, for I always must;
so if your stay with me depends upon the duration
of my affection for her, we are not likely
to separate in this life,&rdquo; observed the young
merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would I were certain of it,&rdquo; murmured
his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of nothing ought you to be more assured,&rdquo;
replied Oriel. &ldquo;Were I entirely to forget the
dazzling beauty of her features, there is an
earnestness of purpose in her character which
will make itself remembered at all times. The
nobility of her sentiments I honoured, by endeavouring
to become worthy of her greatness,
and the confidence with which I was treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
excited in me a desire to act in such a manner
as should give her no cause to withdraw it. In
her person there appeared to me the avatar of
all things noble, fond, and beautiful, and I did
it homage with so earnest a devotion that my
respect soon became an idolatry. I had no enjoyment
except in her presence; I could find
no excellence from which she was absent. I
honoured her above all honour. I regarded her
as the best as well as the dearest of human
beings. I was eloquent in her praise, and devout
in her worship; and thus from day to day
passed the joyous time, teeming with happiness,
and prodigal of honours, till there seemed in
the eyes of each to be no wealth and no distinction
worthy to be desired, which the other
did not possess. Truly was Eureka all the
world to me. An empire was in her love, and
all honourable things were in her gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra had listened attentively, but nothing
save a brighter glow in his lustrous eyes expressed
the interest he took in the conversation.
He did not attempt to interrupt the speaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and when the last sentence was concluded he
made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you add nothing in her praise, Zabra?&rdquo;
asked Oriel Porphyry, after a pause of a few
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She requires no praise, Oriel, certainly none
from me,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;Your applause
is no doubt gratifying to her&mdash;for the heart
that truly loves cannot exist but in the estimation
of the lover. But there is an eulogy beyond
mere praise, for which the devoted are ever
desirous&mdash;the strong and earnest love, whose
voice is action, and whose language is sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that does she possess,&rdquo; rejoined his
companion earnestly. &ldquo;My sympathies are
with her at all times, and at every place, and
there is no act that I perform in which I do not
consider the interpretation I would have it bear
in her affections. I am afraid, Zabra, this encounter
with the pirates has stirred up again
all those ambitious notions I have fostered with
the design of achieving a renown worthy of her
greatness. Certainly my first efforts in traffic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
among such mean scoundrels as Boor and his
brethren, did not give me so exalted an opinion
of my father&rsquo;s profession as he and others
possess. But any opportunity like the one
which has thus accidentally fallen in my way
will throw my blood into a ferment, and make
my spirit yearn after a fair field in which to
develope its energies, as they now exist. Yes,
I feel as if I could only live in a life of enterprise.
Inaction seems to chain me down into
a slavish bondage; but when the weapon is in
my grasp, and the motive within my soul, an
atmosphere of freedom breathes around me, and
I rise above the herd into something nearer the
superiority to which I aspire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what I saw of you in our late affray,
I cannot help acknowledging your capability
for a leader,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;You looked
as if you were born to conquer. Your bearing
was such as would induce thousands to follow
in your footsteps&mdash;and your weapon flashed
annihilation in your path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! it was a paltry enemy,&rdquo; replied
Oriel disdainfully, &ldquo;and they were easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
crushed; but let me be at the head of armies;
let my battle-field be a kingdom, and my enemy
a tyrant, and then I will show of what spirit I
am made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be, Oriel,&rdquo; added the other.
&ldquo;You must be satisfied with what you are; and
as that condition is sufficiently honourable in
the eyes of Eureka, you ought not to indulge
in more ambitious aspirations. The risk you
run in this life of enterprise should also be considered.
Remember that you would hourly be
in danger of immediate death, and if that were
to happen where would be your ambition, and
where would be Eureka&rsquo;s happiness? No! it is
a subject of congratulation that there are no
armies for you to lead, and no tyrants for you
to conquer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There I think you are mistaken,&rdquo; cried his
companion eagerly. &ldquo;If I do not misinterpret
the signs of the times, there is a spirit stirring
in Columbia which will soon make itself evident
in appearances that will not a little alarm its
weak and despotic ruler. There is a cloud over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the face of the whole country, and it will not
be long before it break out into a mighty storm.
Then let them look to themselves. It will
come with a rush that must sweep away every
obstacle before it. The whole of our complicated
machinery of misgovernment will be broken
up into fragments so small, that no future tyrant
shall be able to patch it together again&mdash;and
then will come the day of reckoning for the
people. The task-masters will themselves be
brought to task, and have to con the lessons
they have set others. I only wish to live to see
that day. I only wish to put myself forward
in the movement&mdash;and lead the way that shall
give freedom to my fellow-citizens. I am confident
of the result. No power on earth can
resist a mass of men struggling to break the
bonds by which they have been fettered, when
the impetus by which they are set in motion is
properly directed; and for their chief I know,
I feel I have all the necessary qualifications.
Then I should be in my proper place. Then
would the energies which now render my nature
restless and dissatisfied have ample scope for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
their developement&mdash;and then, Zabra, my friend
and brother, you should behold me performing
such actions as shall more worthily excite your
admiration, than the inglorious one of destroying
a few wretched pirates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You almost convince me of the desirableness
of seeing your visions of glory realised,&rdquo;
remarked Zabra, with increased animation.
&ldquo;I did not imagine it would be possible; but
when I listen to you, I find myself wishing
you to play the noble part for which you are
so well fitted: but then the thought of the
dangers to which you will be exposed fills me
with dread. I know that in you Eureka has
concentrated all her hopes of happiness; and
when I reflect upon the perils of the sort of life
you are desirous of leading, I fear that it will
end in no good to either her or you. But we
will talk of this again at a future time. In
what state have you found the ship and her
cargo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship is as much changed as it is possible
for any vessel to be,&rdquo; replied the merchant&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;I scarcely knew the Albatross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
again. Externally she has not suffered, but
her interior accommodations have been completely
altered. She has been pierced for thirty
guns, all of which are ready for immediate use&mdash;a
powder magazine has been formed out of
one of the cabins, which is abundantly stored
with ammunition&mdash;weapons of every description
are piled up in immense chests&mdash;and
provisions for a long voyage have been carefully
provided. The cargo has not been touched.
It is evident to me, that that scoundrel Compass,
or Death, or whatever his name was, imagined
that I would join him in his nefarious scheme
to entrap my father&rsquo;s vessels; and as he knew
he could not find so good a market for his
plunder by any other plan, he fancied that I
could be induced to assist him in its disposal.
Propositions of this nature he made to me; and
although every time he spoke on the subject I
felt an inclination to hack him into shreds,
seeing the uselessness of any attempt at resistance,
I concealed my indignation as well as I
could, till you communicated to me your plan
for our deliverance. I saw that it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fail of success, if ordinary vigilance was used;
and my hatred of the miscreants by whom I
was detained led me to play my part in the
deception, which was attended with all the
result we anticipated. Your wound is the only
drawback to the delight I feel at our escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, think not of that!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth
warmly: &ldquo;it will soon be healed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; responded Oriel. &ldquo;As for
the captain of the gang, I am only sorry that I
had not an opportunity of acknowledging to him
my obligations. But I think I have spoiled
his career of piracy, that is one subject for congratulation.
His retreat is destroyed&mdash;he has
no vessel&mdash;and one half of his men are as well
provided for as if the hangman had done his
duty. But he was a bold villain. If what he
has said of himself be true, he was fitted for
better things; and from what I remarked in
him, I conclude his narrative was true, at least
a considerable portion of it. It appeared to
me as if he only affected the vulgarity of his
associates; for there were times when his conversation
rose into something much superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to his ordinary language. It is evident that his
intention was to put to sea almost immediately,
and commence a new career of plunder and
violence&mdash;happily we have been enabled to
disappoint him; and I intend, at the first port
we touch at, to add to our crew a sufficient
number of able-bodied seamen, as will not only
work the ship effectively during her voyage,
but will defend her with resolution in case she
should be attacked. Although I have not
more inclination for a mercantile life than when
I first came on board this vessel, I will not, in
any way, unless it be unavoidable, diverge from
the path my father wishes me to pursue, until
I return, and then I shall expect to be allowed
to follow my own inclinations, and choose my
own road to distinction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be so, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Zabra.
&ldquo;Any opposition on my part would be
fruitless&mdash;nay, if it were not for the dangers
which you must encounter in a life of active
warfare, I should be among the first to approve
of your ambitious desires&mdash;I should love to see
you the creator of your own glory&mdash;I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
delight in the honours you would achieve&mdash;I
should rejoice in your renown&mdash;but I must
think of her whom I serve, who, although she
would equally admire your greatness, could not
avoid thinking of the perils of the path by
which only it can be acquired, and must live
in a state of constant anxiety while you were
pursuing your dangerous career. You do
not think sufficiently of her feelings. Why
can you not be satisfied with inheriting the
fame and wealth of your admirable father, and
the happiness which must surely be your own
as long as you prove yourself anxious for its
possession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does the sun shine?&mdash;why does the
tide ebb and flow?&rdquo; said Oriel hastily. &ldquo;They
follow the end for which they were made, and
the same absolute law compels me to make out
the purposes for which I was created. There
is nothing so unreasonable as expecting one
human being to become like another whose nature
is entirely opposite to his. I have known
inconsiderate persons say to one whose disposition
is restless and dissatisfied, and whose inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are violent and ungovernable, &lsquo;Look
at such a one&mdash;he is content with his condition,
and goes on his own quiet way, creating no desire
that cannot easily be indulged; why cannot
you be like him?&rsquo;&mdash;as easily might the
mountain torrent be made like the stream of
the valley. One flows on its own level course,
meeting with no obstruction, and the other, at
every portion of its path, is forced to dash itself
against the unrelenting rocks that oppose its
progress. And how unjust is the manner in
which each individual is regarded! one is
praised for continuing its unvarying tranquillity&mdash;and
the other is censured for the unceasing
turmoil in which it exists. This is
preposterous. No more have such characters
made their own dispositions than the stream
made the level land through which it flows, or
the torrent created the rocks over which it
leaps. Dam up the gentle rivulet with huge
masses of stone, and see how quickly it will
become as much troubled as its unjustly abused
associate of the mountain; and take the rocks
from the path of the torrent, and the quietude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with which it will pursue its course will rival
the tranquillity of its over-lauded brother of the
valley. If there is any praise due at all it is
to him who struggles on against all impediments,
and shows that his spirit is not to be
put down by the obstacles that retard his progress.
Complain of his being restless and dissatisfied&mdash;how
can he be any thing else, when
his soul is kept in a constant fret by the worry
of continual opposition? Say that his inclinations
are violent and ungovernable&mdash;can it ever
be otherwise, when they are daily accumulating
in force, because they are allowed no opportunity
for indulgence? Nothing can be more
unjust to a man thus situated than to tell him
to endeavour to be like another, whose situation
is as opposite to his as are the poles to
one another; and nothing can be more unwise
than to complain of this man, because his disposition
does not resemble that of another,
whose way of life, and habits of thinking, and
hopes and passions, are as different to his as
any two sets of things can possibly be made.
As for me, I am what I am&mdash;neither better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
nor worse. Let those who think me worse than
I am keep to themselves their evil thoughts,
that the force of ill opinion does not make me
become what they unjustly imagine me to be;
but let those who think me better than I am
proclaim to me their flattering testimonials,
that, knowing what excellences they fancy I
possess, I may use every exertion to deem myself
worthy of their good opinion, and at last
succeed in obtaining the very qualities for which
I was undeservedly honoured by their too indulgent
regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Oriel!&rdquo; replied his young companion
affectionately, &ldquo;you know it would be difficult
for any one who knows you well to imagine a
quality of good you have not made your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I listen to you, I must be content to
remain what I am,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, as he
rose to take his leave. &ldquo;And as such a state
of things does not satisfy me, to prevent myself
being spoiled for any better purpose, I must,
for the present, leave you&mdash;of course with my
best wishes for your speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Oriel, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Zabra warmly, returning the affectionate pressure
of the hand he at that moment received,
and following, with his eyes overflowing with
his friendly feelings, the retreating form of his
kind and generous patron.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">AUSTRALIAN CIVILISATION.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Time</span> had passed. The vessel had gone gallantly
on her voyage, and was now quietly
riding at anchor in the port of Sydney, the
magnificent metropolis of the great empire of
Australia. Oriel Porphyry had landed to
transact business with an individual of some
note in that part of the world. Posthumous
was an extensive manufacturer, who had
amassed an immense fortune by a mechanical
discovery he had purchased, by means of which
one machine was made to do the work of ten;
and the funds at his disposal he employed in
forming a museum, which he intended leaving,
at his death, for the benefit of his country.
His love of fame was his ruling passion; and
to acquire it he seemed inclined to make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sacrifice. He accumulated every thing which
he considered rare or curious for his museum;
but, as he was no judge of the value of the
collection he was forming, he often purchased
things perfectly worthless, merely because they
were recommended to him as objects that might
be regarded with the greatest interest by posterity.
To all who visited him, his pride was
to exhibit his collection; and, although none
were more ignorant of its real nature than
himself, none could expatiate so much at
length upon its merits. He was a walking
catalogue&mdash;a talking index&mdash;a living table
of contents; and he seemed as if he knew of
no pleasure that did not allow him to display
his museum and gossip about every specimen it
contained.</p>

<p>Oriel and Zabra were walking together to
the residence of the person thus described,
when the former, doubtful as to whether he
was pursuing the right direction, observing a
man leaning against a post near a crossing at a
short distance, went up to him for the purpose
of making inquiries as to the exact locality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the place of which he was in search. The man
was a street sweeper. His broom was beside
him; and he was so intent upon a book he
appeared to be studying, that Oriel noticed its
title. It was &ldquo;Geometry for Beggars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray can you direct me to Botany Square?&rdquo;
inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Botany Square is an ellipsis,&rdquo; replied the
matter-of-fact sweeper; &ldquo;but if the transverse,
conjugate, and abscissa are known, it is easy to
find the ordinate. To proceed to it from this
point requires a right line to where the next
street appears at a right angle with it, whence,
going along any part of its superficies, you will
approach where the sides of three streets form
an isosceles triangle; take the one side nearest
to you in its whole extent, which having found,
describe the area of a trapezium, whose diagonal
is equal to twice its perpendiculars; and
from the centre continue a right line till you
approach a trapezoid whose sides are parallel;
and from this, diverging in such a manner as
to construct a hyperbola, if straight lines be
drawn from the centre through the extremities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of its conjugate axis, these will lead direct to
the ellipsis you are desirous of finding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you direct me to Botany Square?&rdquo;
again asked Oriel Porphyry, puzzled to think
whether the man was mad or did not understand
his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Botany Square is an ellipsis, I tell you
again,&rdquo; said the geometrician rather sharply;
&ldquo;and Euclid himself could not have described to
you a more accurate method of finding it than
that you have just heard from me. Work the
problem properly, and the result must be what
you require. All the parts are equal to the
whole; the greater includes the less; and of
several equal parts all are alike: and these
propositions are not more true than is the answer
I have given to your query; therefore
allow me to hope that you will, in consideration
of the accuracy of my analysis, find the perpendicular
of your pocket, subtract from its
base any circle whose circumference is a known
quantity, and place it within the superficies of
my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel, walking on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s minus!&rdquo; cried the beggar, and returned
to his geometry.</p>

<p>The two pedestrians continued on their way,
wondering not a little at meeting with the
strange character with whom they had just
parted, when, upon entering the next street,
they observed a confused mass of people running
to and fro, shouting and making a most
discordant uproar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me the cause of this disturbance?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel Porphyry, addressing
a respectable looking mechanic who was
hurrying past him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cause?&rdquo; replied the stranger, immediately
stopping in his career. &ldquo;The cause
is always the phenomenon which precedes the
effect. Philosophers have disputed about the
most appropriate definition of the term; but
in any system of transcendental ideas there
must always be an antecedency and a subsequency;
and although they have been considered
synchronous in their existence, in
my opinion the effect is to the cause what the
shadow is to the light&mdash;the shadow is not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the light, but is produced by the operation of
the light upon an object; so the effect is not
in the cause, but is produced by the action of
the cause upon an agent. Some metaphysicians
conceive that the relation of cause and effect
should be considered as a synthetical judgment
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>&mdash;a postulate of pure reason. In my
opinion, this idea is open to many objections;
but I will avoid all argument on that point for
the present, and merely go into an analysis of
the nature of causation. There are three indispensable
conditions to any philosophical
theory of causation. In the first place, there
are two objects&mdash;the agent and the patient.
Secondly, there are three changes, which are&mdash;that
of the agent, reason of the effect; that of
the patient, effect of the action; that which
is produced by the patient on the agent, and
the effect of re-action. And, thirdly, there are
four distinct moments, which are&mdash;that which
leads to the action, that which commences with
it, that of the re-action, and that which immediately
follows the re-action. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray, sir, what has all this to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the disturbance about which I inquired?&rdquo; said
the young merchant, as much puzzled with the
mechanic as he was by the beggar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked for the cause, and I am explaining
to you all the phenomena which a
cause may produce,&rdquo; responded the other.
&ldquo;But I regret I cannot stop to describe to
you my original ideas on the subject. If you
are anxious to apply your mind to their investigation,
you will find them in the Philosophical
Chimney-sweep&rsquo;s Penny Magazine; and if
I can be of service to you in any other way,
you can always command me on the shortest
notice, and on the most reasonable terms.&rdquo; So
saying, he placed a card in Oriel&rsquo;s hand, and
was very quickly out of sight. The card was
of a pink colour, was glazed and embossed;
and on it was elegantly engraved, &ldquo;Leibnitz
Kant Chummy, Chimney-sweep and Nightman
to the Royal Family, in all its branches.&rdquo; The
two friends found quite as much wonder as
amusement in what they had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been told that these Australians
were the most enlightened people on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
earth,&rdquo; remarked Oriel; &ldquo;but I certainly
never expected to be mystified after this
fashion by two individuals belonging to the
very lowest ranks, upon merely asking a simple
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are exceptions to the mass,&rdquo;
replied Zabra; &ldquo;and every one else we meet
we shall doubtless find as common-place as we
require. Try this old fish-woman: it will be
extraordinary, indeed, if you meet with either
geometry or metaphysics in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel approached a female whose sex was
scarcely distinguishable, as she squatted by a
basket of fish, in a man&rsquo;s old great coat and
hat. She observed a stranger advancing towards
her; and, believing him to be a customer, she
held up one of her fish so as to put all its good
qualities into the best situation for minute
inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine and fresh&mdash;worthy to make a dinner
for a prince!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good woman, can you tell me the
attraction which brings all these people together?&rdquo;
asked Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment the old hag put down her fish,
and, with the seriousness of a Socrates, replied,
&ldquo;There are three kinds of attraction; which
are, the mathematical, the mathematico-physical,
and the physical attraction: of which of
these do you require a definition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound the people, they&rsquo;re all alike!&rdquo;
exclaimed the young merchant; but the old
dame, without noticing the exclamation, continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose A to be a glass of any comfortable
liquor with which you may feel inclined to
treat me, and B my mouth, which is at all
times very desirous of a coalition with the
same. When A moves towards B, it is evident
that B has the power directly or indirectly of
drawing or attracting A; and when you notice
this, and measure the law of the motion, and
discover that A moves as if attracted towards
B by some simple law, you will easily be
enabled to ascertain what will take place if the
motion continue. This is mathematical attraction.
When it becomes evident that A
not only moves towards B, but that B is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
agent in the motion created, as, to satisfy the
thirst or inclination of B, A is attracted towards
it, A always moving where there is thirst or
inclination, but never where neither exist, then
this is called mathematico-physical attraction.
And when, by a power existing in B, A is
drawn towards it without any other exciting
cause; thus, if nothing else in the world
existed but A and B in a state of rest, and A
move towards B by some influence which is as
much a part of its nature as its thirst or inclination,
then would be created what is called
physical attraction. And now, for a trifle, I
will give you the most convincing demonstration
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of all these phenomena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perdition seize your A and B, I say!&rdquo;
cried Oriel, as he hastily left the old woman to
her philosophy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An exemplification of repulsion!&rdquo; muttered
she, as she again commenced endeavouring to
dispose of her fish.</p>

<p>Oriel and his companion had entered a street
of shops, in which they had no sooner made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their appearance than they were surrounded by
a crowd of tradespeople, bawling in their ears
the excellence and cheapness of their commodities,
and endeavouring to pull or entice
them into their warehouses, the exteriors of
which were covered with immense placards,
proclaiming the ruin of the sellers, and the
advantages which in consequence would accrue
to the fortunate buyers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Full fifty per cent. under cost price!&rdquo; cried
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred per cent. below the cost, be
assured!&rdquo; shouted another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be ruined in a week, sir!&rdquo; proclaimed
a third, as if rejoicing at the near
approach of his destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> ruined!&rdquo; screamed a fourth, in a tone
of emphatic exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My family must starve!&rdquo; exclaimed a fifth,
without the slightest expression of regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My family <em>are</em> starving!&rdquo; confessed a sixth,
as if it was a subject of the greatest congratulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seven children, sir!&rdquo; whispered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
little man, apparently as the most enticing recommendation
of his goods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a wife and ten!&rdquo; bawled a companion,
in a voice of triumph that seemed to
silence all competition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best goods!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very best!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine are the cheapest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine are much cheaper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus they went on shouting at and
pulling the two young men about, till they
were obliged to seek refuge in one of the
shops; but immediately they entered the
threshold, the whole body of eager applicants
for custom left the strangers to the care of their
more fortunate fellow-tradesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really you shopkeepers seem inclined to
tear your customers to pieces,&rdquo; observed Oriel
Porphyry with considerable indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely the effect of competition, sir,&rdquo;
coolly replied the chapman, spreading out his
wares for inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is a competition that must be
exceedingly disagreeable to the purchaser,&rdquo;
said the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped, sir,&rdquo; added the man in
the same careless tone. &ldquo;When the supply
exceeds the demand, the value of this overproduction
must greatly diminish; and every
attempt will be made to produce, at any loss,
an increased consumption. How many pairs
of these gloves would you like to have, sir?
You shall have them at a small advance beyond
the cost of their carriage from the place in
which they were manufactured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have no cash about me,&rdquo; acknowledged
Oriel, thinking it would be sufficient to
avoid a purchase that was not necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not of the slightest consequence, sir. I
will gladly give you credit to any amount,&rdquo; said
the obliging tradesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! why I am a perfect stranger in the
country,&rdquo; observed his unwilling customer with
much surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter, sir,&rdquo; added the other; &ldquo;public
credit must be supported; all business transactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
are done upon its responsibility. Ready
money is destructive of all the true interests of
trade; for, as capital in a state overcrowded in
population can never be created in a supply
sufficient for the wants of the community, the
surest way of preventing those dangerous revolutions
which so often affect the monied interests
of a great commercial nation is to trade entirely
with fictitious capital. This is credit, sir; and
we use every means within our power to create
it to an extent sufficient to supply all our
wants, and to support it in all its sufficiency
when it is established. The manufacturer supplies
the wholesale dealer; the wholesale dealer
provides the retail tradesman; and the retail
tradesman carries on his business with his customers
upon the sure foundation of credit.
Not a coin is seen in the hands of either party
from one year&rsquo;s end to the other; and a man&rsquo;s
wealth is known not by the mere exchangeable
property he possesses, but by the extent of the
credit he is allowed. Political economy is a
wonderful science, sir; and the ancients were
entirely ignorant of its true principles. Shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
I put you up a few dozen of these stockings?
the price, I assure you, does not pay for the
raw material.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well; as you seem desirous of ruining
yourself, I do not see that I ought to stand
in your way; so you may let me have a dozen
pairs of the stockings and of the gloves,&rdquo; said
Master Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied the tradesman.
&ldquo;But as for ruin, sir, is it not done for the
public good? Think what a man having a
wife and ten children to support must feel
when he knows that he has reduced them and
himself to absolute starvation for the advantage
of the community&mdash;for the greatest
happiness of the greatest number, sir. Beautiful
feeling, sir; exquisite consolation; a
perfect patriotism! He knows that he becomes
a martyr for his country. Think of that, sir!
He is conscious of being made a victim for the
general advantage. Think of that, sir! And
while his skin and bones hang together, he feels
the sweet solace that he is allowed to make
himself a sacrifice for the wants of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
never heard of his name. Think of that, sir!
Any other article, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at present. It is wonderful to me how,
in such a state of things, men can be brought
to enter into the pursuits of trade,&rdquo; observed
his customer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the effect of competition, sir,&rdquo; answered
the man quietly. &ldquo;Fine thing competition.
We should none of us enjoy the satisfaction of
being ruined, if it was not for competition; and
the beautiful principle of it is, sir, that it makes
a man consider that he is greatest honoured
who is soonest ruined; therefore we all run a
race&mdash;and a very anxious race it is, I assure
you. We undersell each other&mdash;we dispose of
our goods at a certain loss&mdash;we even give them
away&mdash;and happy is the man who is ruined
before his rivals. Admirable thing, competition!
Where shall I send them, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send them to Master Porphyry, on board
the ship Albatross, now in the harbour, and I
will call and pay you before I depart,&rdquo; replied
the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, sir,&rdquo; said the tradesman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, I entreat. Nay, I
should be just as well pleased were you to forget
it altogether, for then I shall be a step nearer
to the honour I so much covet&mdash;the distinction
of being ruined before any other person in the
same line of business in my immediate neighbourhood.
I am grateful to you for your
favours. Any thing you may require, sir&mdash;the
most extensive order you can give me I
shall be happy to supply on the same advantageous
terms. Any thing you like to accept,
sir, is at your disposal. I implore you to have
the generosity to assist in my ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra and his companion, at last, with great
difficulty, got out of the shop, and proceeded,
unmolested, on their way, till they came to an
opening in the street, where several men seemed
to be preaching from little elevations, each to
his own separate congregation, yet frequently
alluding to their coadjutors, in such terms as
clearly proved that they were rivals in the trade
they had adopted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my children, to me, and I will expound
to you the law by which alone you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
be saved from everlasting punishment,&rdquo; exclaimed
a fat faced little old man to his audience.
&ldquo;Fly from the things of this world&mdash;pay your
teachers liberally&mdash;care not for eating or
drinking, or amusing yourselves with idle pleasures,
and you shall live in eternal happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire and brimstone! Flame and torment!
Prepare for these, my beloved brethren!&rdquo; shouted
a lank fellow with a most hypocritical physiognomy.
&ldquo;Ye who are the elect shall enjoy the
good things, but scorching and burning shall be
the everlasting portion of those who are not of
our communion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heed not the voices of ungodly men, to
whom the evangelical grace has not descended,&rdquo;
cried a stern-visaged preacher. &ldquo;Our way is a
way of mercy, a way of charity, and a way of
peace. But rejoice, oh my hearers! for the
time is not afar off when we will smite the unbelievers
from shoulder to hip, till their name
be utterly removed from the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear a voice which none can understand,
but which is sent to enlighten the universe,&rdquo;
screamed one, whose brilliant eyes and wild expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of countenance seemed marked by the
influence of insanity&mdash;&ldquo;Hu&mdash;ugh&mdash;hullabaloo&mdash;scrikey-smash&mdash;drido&mdash;snolk&mdash;hi
ha botherum&mdash;pickwickicksicceriggidiggy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell thee, friend, thy way is the way of
perdition, humph,&rdquo; exclaimed another, with a
nasal twang, and a clean sleek appearance.
&ldquo;Verily it is the way of the bottomless pit.
There is no virtue save under a beaver with a
broad brim, humph! and the spirit can only be
found in vestments of a formal cut, and of a
drab colour, humph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave those heretics, my children, who can
only hurry you on the road of iniquity, and
enter the bosom of the true church,&rdquo; shouted a
brawny fellow in the dress of a mendicant.
&ldquo;Here is holy water, and here are relics that
have the power of saving your souls from purgatory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abominations&mdash;abominations&mdash;the abominations
of the scarlet one of Babylon!&rdquo; cried
one opposite to him with looks of horror and
indignation. &ldquo;Leave them, and I will sprinkle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
water upon you, which will render you a sheep
of our fold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sprinkling is of no avail!&rdquo; shrieked a melancholy
fanatic. &ldquo;Come and be dipped&mdash;come
and be dipped into the waters of everlasting
righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fader Aprahams!&mdash;Fader Aprahams!&rdquo;
said a dark visaged old man with a long beard,
as he smote his breast, and turned up his eyes
to heaven. &ldquo;How long shall these obstacles
remain in the way of thy chosen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the Jew!&rdquo; bawled the rest in
hideous chorus&mdash;&ldquo;Down with the unrelenting
Jew! Our religion is one of universal love.
Cut the Jew into a thousand pieces, and cast
him to the dogs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us leave these miserable brawlers,&rdquo;
exclaimed Oriel, hurrying his companion from
the spot. &ldquo;Truly has my father said that the
only religion is philanthropy, and the only
worship of God consists in doing good to man.
Nothing annoys me so much as observing a
parcel of noisy fellows sowing dissension around
them on the hypocritical pretence of teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the surest means of saving sinners from perdition.
Disputes about religion, entered into by persons
professing different forms of faith, may be compared
to the wranglings of a party of men concerning
the excellence of different roads in a
country of the geography of which all are ignorant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not judge of the whole class
of teachers by such examples as we have just
passed,&rdquo; remarked Zabra. &ldquo;That the general
influence of the clerical profession is beneficial
has been denied by some narrow-minded men,
who, because there have been a few instances of
unworthiness obtaining distinction in the church,
and of vicious propensities disgracing a professed
teacher of virtue, denounce the institution
that created them as unlikely to produce any
real good to the community. But who condemns
a fruitful tree, because, while it bears a
profitable crop, a handful of blighted fruit may
occasionally be found on its branches? The
clergy are but a section of the vast mass of the
social fabric; and it is as absurd for any one with
a knowledge of human nature, to expect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
every individual member of its body should be
led into the profession by no other motive than
the love of virtue, as to imagine that every soldier
should be brave and join the ranks only from a
desire for glory&mdash;or, that every lawyer should
be honest, and embrace the law exclusively to
advocate the principles of justice. It is, certainly,
a natural expectation, that all who affect
to show others the road to heaven should travel
that way themselves, and to satisfy this expectation
is the grand object of the institution of
priesthood; but it is as rare that the allurements
of the world can be prevented producing vicious
effects upon those who are obliged to mingle in
them, as it is difficult to guard against the encroachments
of a disease by those who are forced
to inhale an infectious atmosphere. The wonder
should be, not that any fall, but that so many
escape. When we come to consider the immense
contributions to the general stock of intelligence
afforded by the clergy, which embrace
every branch of human learning and scientific
acquirement&mdash;the active benevolence of at least
a large majority&mdash;their unceasing endeavours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to instil into the hearts of the people the refreshing
influence of a pure system of morals&mdash;and
the effect of their individual respectability
in commanding attention to the great object for
which they labour&mdash;illiberal indeed must he
be who denies the utility of an establishment
productive of so much good. To despise a
sporting parson, a political priest, or a fashionable
divine, is both right and natural, and they
must receive condemnation from all who know
how to appreciate the actions of a servant who
serves any master but his own; but while an
acknowledgment must be regretfully made of
the existence of such hypocritical pretenders in
the ranks of the church, when we reflect upon
the vast fund of real piety, of pure philanthropy,
and of sound learning it possesses, the influence
of which cannot be otherwise than beneficial in
the highest degree, we should rejoice that there
is a class of men in existence that provides so
liberally for the moral wants of the people,
which, both by the precept and example of its
worthiest members, affords such admirable means
for counteracting the evil effects likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
produced by its inefficient or immoral brethren.
That the clergy produce good, it is impossible
to deny; and that they do not produce so much
good as is desirable, arises more from inaptitude
in the community to be taught, than from want
of ability in the clergy to instruct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You deserve a rich benefice for your defence,
Zabra,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, with a
smile; &ldquo;and I have no doubt if those sentiments
continue, and you embrace the profession, you
will become one of the highest dignitaries of the
church. But what is this fellow talking about
so earnestly? More wonders, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a man ill-clad and ill-looking, who
carried a bundle of papers in his hand, which
he was trying to sell to the persons who were
listening attentively to some intelligence he
was bawling in the street with all the strength
of his lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary example of combustion!&rdquo;
shouted the fellow. &ldquo;All the materials of
matter which made up the bodies of Cutandrun,
the famous inventor of infallible fire-escapes,
and his family, have been placed in a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
decomposition by the action of phlogiston upon
his house and stock. Here is a philosophical
account, detailing the causes and effects of the
phenomena&mdash;giving a scientific analysis of the
ashes found in different situations&mdash;with an
entirely new theory of the laws which render
combustion so destructive in its agency upon
inflammable matter. Only one penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is certainly one way of describing
a fire,&rdquo; observed Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;But
chemistry, I suppose, is as well understood
here as other branches of science appear to
be. However, we must be proceeding, or we
shall never arrive at our destination. As I am
very doubtful about the right direction, I
think we had better avail ourselves of one of
these vehicles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The director of a small light carriage for
two persons was then hailed; and the two
friends were about to enter it, when several
boys, carrying bundles of papers, ran up to
them, and commenced vociferating with loud
voices entreaties to purchase their goods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy the Sydney Philosophical and Critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Quarterly Review. Only one penny,&rdquo; cried one
little urchin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Universal Encyclopædia of Useful
Knowledge, only one halfpenny,&rdquo; exclaimed
a second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither are to be compared to these treatises
by the Society for the Diffusion of Science
among the Insane, sir,&mdash;only one farthing!&rdquo;
bawled a third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with you!&rdquo; shouted Oriel Porphyry,
as he sprang into the carriage, followed
by his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what velocity shall I apply the power?&rdquo;
inquired the conductor very civilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, moderate; and put me down at the
house of Posthumous, in Botany Square,&rdquo; said
his customer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an article on the ponderability of
imponderable substances; worth double the
money for the whole review,&rdquo; cried one of the
little booksellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a treatise on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but what it was
on must remain unknown; for both Zabra and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his patron were far out of sight and hearing of
their tormentors before the last sentence was
concluded; and, in a few minutes, they found
themselves opposite a stately mansion, which
they stopped some time to examine. It seemed
an edifice of more modern date than any near it
on either side. A flight of broad steps led, under
a small portico supported by pillars which in
thickness seemed to rival their length, to an
entrance by folding doors large enough to admit
a regiment of soldiers, over which was
placed three draperied figures in marble, sculptured
as large as life, blowing trumpets towards
three points of the compass, and dropping each
a wreath upon the bust of a man with a foolish
countenance, upon the base of which, in large
letters, was conspicuously placed the name
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Posthumous</span>.&rdquo; Small windows were on each
side, and above the door. Over the portico was
placed a row of caryatidæ, resembling opera
dancers making a pirouette, that supported an
entablature, upon which a cumbrous attic was
raised, forming an elevation as heavy and incongruous
as it is possible to conceive.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III">CHAP. III.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">POSTHUMOUS AND HIS MUSEUM.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">With</span> considerable parade Oriel Porphyry and
his companion were ushered through long passages
containing a variety of monstrous antiquities,
into a small room filled with books
and curiosities, where, at a curiously shaped
table covered with a number of strange things,
sat the original of the bust over the door&mdash;a
man much beyond the middle age, with a short
body, long legs and arms, broad shoulders, a
clumsy head, and a foolish face. He was dressed
in a tawdry morning gown, and was examining
some articles of rarity brought him by several
dealers, who were waiting till he had made his
purchases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell me that this is a very rare copy,&rdquo;
said Posthumous, appearing to regard with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
much attention a large book he held in his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only copy in existence, sir, I assure
you,&rdquo; replied the bookseller. &ldquo;It fetched
thirty guineas at the sale of Bookworm&rsquo;s
library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are quite convinced that it is the
stupidest book that ever was published?&rdquo; inquired
the collector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have abundant testimonials to prove it,
sir,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;The fact is, that the
work, when published, which was as much as
a thousand years ago, was so generally attacked
by the reviewers for the incomprehensible nonsense
with which it was filled, that the author,
in a fit of shame, tried to buy up all the copies;
and in this design he succeeded, with the exception
of the one you have, which had fortunately
fallen into the hands of a person
celebrated for collecting works of a similar nature.
All the rest were destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how much do you want for it?&rdquo; asked
the buyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are a particular customer, and as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
am very desirous that it should enrich the
Posthumous Library, for which it is admirably
adapted, I shall only ask you twenty pounds,&rdquo;
said the seller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mine&mdash;and there&rsquo;s the money!&rdquo; exclaimed
the former, as if delighted with his
purchase. &ldquo;And you are quite sure it is decidedly
the stupidest book in existence?&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am positive,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inestimable treasure!&rdquo; cried the collector,
clasping the volume in an ecstasy. &ldquo;Now has
the Posthumous Library a jewel which the
whole world could not rival. Have you anything
else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is an unique copy of a very rare work,
called &lsquo;The Philosophy of Flea-catching,&rsquo; in
sheets, clean and uncut. The learned Scribble-gossip
says that this volume has now become
so scarce that there is only one other copy extant,
which is in the public library in India.
This, however, has one important advantage
over the other, which renders it of incalculably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
more value; for, if you notice, it has the Finis
at the end printed backwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; muttered his patron, as he
noticed the extraordinary feature. &ldquo;And what
shall I pay you for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only ten guineas, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they are; and much reason will
posterity have to congratulate itself that I am
the fortunate possessor of &lsquo;The Philosophy of
Flea-catching,&rsquo; with the Finis printed backwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so, sir, exactly. Your observations
are always full of meaning. I wish you
good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Catalogue, good morning&mdash;and
mind you show me everything rare that
comes into your possession,&rdquo; cried Posthumous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, sir, you shall always have
the first refusal,&rdquo; replied Catalogue; and he
took his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have you brought me wrapt up
in that green baize, Marble?&rdquo; inquired the
wealthy manufacturer, of a little shrivelled old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
man, who had been waiting for an opportunity
to exhibit the article he had for sale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An antique&mdash;a real antique, sir!&rdquo; said
the little fellow, hastily taking off the covering.
&ldquo;The bust of a beautiful lady of rank, from the
the chisel of the immortal Chantrey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why she hasn&rsquo;t any nose!&rdquo; exclaimed the
virtuoso in a tone of disappointment. &ldquo;Her
face is battered to pieces, and she has lost half
her shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the more valuable for that, sir,&rdquo; replied
the man very coolly. &ldquo;It shows its antiquity.
I could have brought you many things
more handsome to look upon, but so rare a
piece of sculpture I have never yet had in my
possession. Look how exquisitely that neck is
formed! Charming, sir. Though not a feature
is visible, the bust breathes an air of grace
which it is impossible to look on without admiring.
Sawdust, the great timber merchant,
offered me fifty guineas for it to adorn his
gallery, but I remembered that my generous
and enlightened patron Posthumous was forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a museum, and, knowing that this was the
very thing he required, refused the offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good of you, Marble. I detest that
Sawdust; he has no taste,&rdquo; remarked the collector.
&ldquo;But are you sure this is an antique?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I sure of my existence, sir?&rdquo; replied
the little man, looking as dignified as he could.
&ldquo;My judgment in these matters is infallible.
But as you do not seem to appreciate the merit
of this beautiful example of art, I shall take it
to Sawdust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for the world, Marble!&rdquo; exclaimed
Posthumous, producing the money. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the price; but, I must say, I should have liked
it all the better if it had possessed something
like a human countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, sir, that is not of the
slightest consequence,&rdquo; said the man, as he
pocketed the money. &ldquo;The spirit of a great
artist is upon it, and that is all that a connoisseur
should look to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have you there?&rdquo; inquired the
purchaser, perceiving that the dealer was uncovering
another specimen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A picture, sir&mdash;and <em>such</em> a picture!&rdquo;
responded the man emphatically, as he proceeded
to place a small old oil painting in what
he considered the most advantageous light.
&ldquo;A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, sir; a work of one of the old
masters. An undoubted original. Don&rsquo;t you
feel a sort of emotion overpower you as you
stand before it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I do feel rather queer; but I thought
it was indigestion,&rdquo; replied the connoisseur,
closely examining the picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Psha!&rdquo; exclaimed the little man rather
contemptuously. &ldquo;You ought to feel the all-pervading
influence of superior genius. You
are looking upon a master-piece. Do you remark
the harmony with which the colours are
blended in that wonderful production, the
poetical treatment of the subject, and the
sweet repose that pervades the picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the patron,
looking a little puzzled, &ldquo;I have been examining
it very closely, and I can see nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The effect of the great age of the picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sir,&rdquo; responded the dealer. &ldquo;The influence of
time has destroyed every vestige of colour on
the canvass; and it is impossible to make out
a single feature in the painting. But be assured,
sir, it is a wonderful production&mdash;an
invaluable work of art. Emperors would be
glad of such an addition to their collections;
and artists would travel over half the world to
gaze upon an example so unique. I have had
many handsome offers for it, sir. Sawdust bid
very high. He knew its value, sir. But I
resolved that it should enrich the invaluable
Posthumous collection of paintings; and I
therefore offer it to you at the low price of
two hundred guineas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;m obliged to you, Marble,&rdquo;
remarked the manufacturer, still poking his
foolish face as close to the canvass as he could,
and apparently hesitating about making the
purchase. &ldquo;That fellow Sawdust has no soul
for these things. But what is it about, Marble?
I should like to know the subject. Tell
me what it is about, Marble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, it is about&mdash;as far as I and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the best judges can ascertain&mdash;it is about the
most ancient painting in the world,&rdquo; replied
the dealer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very fine subject,&rdquo; said the connoisseur;
&ldquo;and now I do begin to perceive a sort of a
what&rsquo;s-a-name. But do you think posterity
would applaud my giving such a price for such
a painting with such a subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could not do otherwise than greatly
applaud your fine discrimination and admirable
liberality,&rdquo; responded the little man with all
the enthusiasm of a picture-dealer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have it,&rdquo; remarked Posthumous,
as he paid the money; &ldquo;posterity will
reward my exertions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of it, sir. I wish you
good morning,&rdquo; cried the man, bustling out of
the room with an air of peculiar satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, Marble,&rdquo; exclaimed
the collector, still closely examining the painting;
&ldquo;and if you have any thing rare, be sure
to let me know. But, if it be in sculpture, I
should prefer seeing something with a nose to
it; and if it be a painting, although this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
capital subject, I should like it to be a little
more easily made out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will endeavour to meet your wishes,&rdquo; said
the dealer; and he made his bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital subject!&rdquo; continued the connoisseur,
still intently poring over his puzzling
purchase: &ldquo;capital subject&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t see
it very clearly yet. There is a something there,
and there is a something here; but&mdash;hullo,
gentlemen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, noticing his visitors
for the first time. &ldquo;I beg pardon; but I really
did not know you were in the room. Have
you brought me any curiosities&mdash;any thing
rare or antique?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This letter will explain to you our business,&rdquo;
replied Oriel Porphyry, handing a note
across the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, my good sir, sit down,&rdquo; cried
the antiquarian; and, on his visitors complying
with his request, he proceeded slowly to read
the letter; and, during the period he took in
its perusal, Oriel amused himself with examining
the extraordinary contents of the room in
which he was sitting. The chamber was low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and dark, and every corner in it was filled with
books heaped up together, without the slightest
attempt at arrangement; some glittering with
handsome bindings, new and unsoiled; and
others old and ragged, covered with dirt, and
dark with age. With these were pictures,
some leaning against the wall, some upon
chairs, others one upon another upon the
floor, surrounded by huge fragments of stone,
broken pieces of statuary, bronzes, ancient
weapons, specimens of pottery, and a variety
of other antiquities. Here was a full-length
statue deprived of a leg, there an antique bust
with half a nose; in one place a vase gaping
with a conspicuous fracture, in another a sepulchral
urn chipped out of all resemblance to
what it once was. Of all the varied contents
of the room, there remained nothing that had
not in some manner been rendered useless,
if at any time it had been considered of value,
or, if perfect, had the slightest pretensions to
be considered antique. But the most amusing
piece of antiquity in this collection was evidently
the proprietor, whose face and head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
expressed a more perfect appearance of want
of intellect than the most skilful sculptor could
have produced. His nose was a bulging lump
of flesh, that looked like any thing but the
thing for which it was intended; his eyes were
deep set in his head, and were continually
gazing in a settled stare of foolish wonder and
delight; and his mouth, which was more than
usually large, when its possessor was not talking
stood invitingly half open, as if to ensnare
all the flies in its neighbourhood. And with
these characteristics there was a pompous manner
with which he said his foolish nothings,
that rendered the man more highly ridiculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have come to purchase, instead of
to sell,&rdquo; exclaimed he with much astonishment.
&ldquo;I had rather you had brought me some rare
antiques to enrich my museum&mdash;the Posthumous
Museum, as it is called. Do they talk
of it in Columbia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say I ever heard it mentioned,&rdquo;
said Oriel, endeavouring to conceal a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! posterity will do me honour; and it
is for posterity I labour,&rdquo; added the manufacturer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I will give orders about what
you require by and by. In the meantime, you
must take up your abode with me, that you
may be enabled to appreciate all the wonderful
things I have collected in my museum for the
benefit of posterity, that, when you return to
your country, you may say how invaluable is
the Posthumous Museum, and how enlightened
and liberal is he who has spent a large
fortune in collecting together its precious contents!
I shall have a conversazione this evening,
when you will meet with some of the most
celebrated literati in this great empire; till
then, I will endeavour to amuse you by making
you aware of the value of this unrivalled collection
of antiquities. In the first place, you
behold this dagger,&rdquo; said he, showing an ordinary
weapon of that description. &ldquo;Well, this is
the identical dagger that Macbeth saw in the
air when he exclaimed, &lsquo;Is this a dagger that I
see before me?&rsquo; and so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Macbeth merely imagined that he beheld
such a weapon,&rdquo; observed Oriel, amused
at the credulity of his host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; and this is the very weapon
Macbeth imagined he beheld,&rdquo; replied the antiquarian.
&ldquo;It is undoubtedly genuine: I
have documents to prove it. This is the very
seal with which Magna Charta signed King
John&mdash;no!&mdash;King John signed Runnemede&mdash;no,
that&rsquo;s not it either&mdash;Runnemede signed
the Barons&mdash;I am not just sure I have it now,
but it must be one or the other. And this is
the very seal;&rdquo; and he produced a seal about
the size of a small lantern. &ldquo;Here is an undoubted
Jew&rsquo;s harp&mdash;a great rarity. I don&rsquo;t
know what Jew it belonged to; but its genuineness
is placed beyond suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It bears no resemblance to the harps in
present use, either in size or appearance,&rdquo; remarked
Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A proof of its great antiquity,&rdquo; replied
Posthumous. &ldquo;You see it has but one string.
Now, it is upon record that, at a remote age,
there was a fiddler called Pagan Ninny. Whether
he was called a pagan because he was a
ninny, or a ninny because he was a pagan, it is
impossible to prove; but certain it is that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
played upon one string; and he played so well,
that instruments upon one string came into
fashion both among the Pagans and the Jews;
and that is the reason why there is but one
string to this Jew&rsquo;s harp. You observe this
cake of mineral substance,&rdquo; he continued,
pointing to a small bluish mass. &ldquo;There is
a deep interest attached to this specimen. I
never look at it without feeling emotions of&mdash;that
is to say, emotions of a what&rsquo;s-a-name,
with which every monied man must sympathise.
It is the remains of a great man&mdash;of a
very great man&mdash;of a man whose credit with
the world was exceeded by none in his day.
It is the ashes of Abraham Newland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The manufacturer turned away, but whether
to conceal a tear or to produce another curiosity
was doubtful; however he was only a few seconds
before he again approached his visitors,
bearing a large fragment of wood crumbling into
decay. &ldquo;But here, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here
is an object that cannot fail to awaken&mdash;to
awaken&mdash;that is to say, it cannot fail to awaken,
but what it ought to awaken I do not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
remember now; however, that is not of the
slightest consequence. You have, no doubt,
read of England, a very ancient island. Well,
the inhabitants being very industrious did not
like being disturbed by their neighbours, an
idle dishonest set of rascals, who were continually
coming upon their territory and doing
a great deal of damage; so to keep out these
troublesome marauders&mdash;marauders&mdash;marauders?&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s the word, and having very
fine forests of timber in their country, they
surrounded their island with wooden walls; and
this specimen, gentlemen, is an unquestionable
fragment of the wooden walls of old England,
procured for me at great expense by a traveller,
who being in that part of the world found it in
the remains of a wall within a very short distance
of the sea-coast. It is the only antiquity
of the kind in existence. None but the Posthumous
Museum can boast of such an invaluable
relic of the ancient ages: for posterity I acquired
it, and for having become its fortunate
possessor posterity will not fail to do justice to
my memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Posthumous continued to give descriptions of
a great variety of similar objects in the same
fashion, till he approached some pictures, one
of which he selected with great care, and placed
in a favourable light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this picture, gentlemen!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as his foolish face endeavoured to express
something like wonder and admiration.
&ldquo;Observe the chiaro-scuro&mdash;the chiaro-scuro?&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s the word, though I don&rsquo;t exactly
remember what it means. Admire the foreshortening&mdash;the
harmony&mdash;the repose&mdash;the
expression, and all that. Fine effect&mdash;admirable
picture! The subject is Joshua commanding
his son to stand still. Excellent subject!
The son was a very restless boy, gentlemen,
who required to be ruled with rather a high
hand; so Mister Joshua, a good sort of father
too, by all accounts, was obliged to teach him
to be quiet in a manner boys don&rsquo;t in general
admire. It is painted by the immortal Snooks.
Talk of Rubens, and Raphael, and Corregio,
and Titian, and others of the ancients,&mdash;they
were never to be compared to the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Snooks&mdash;the sublime, the incomparable,
the illustrious Snooks. He had such a
miraculous&mdash;such an extraordinary&mdash;such an
unrivalled&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what it was; but he
had something, at any rate, that was very fine,
and gave a sort of wonderful incomprehensible&mdash;you
understand me&mdash;to such a degree, that
seven-and-twenty cities have carried on a most
violent dispute about which had the honour of
giving him birth, and each erected a stupendous
monument, having nothing else upon
it but this sublime inscription, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Here
Snooks was Born!</span>&rsquo; But when he died, gentlemen,
there was a regular scramble for his remains,
and one carried away an arm, another
a leg, a third took possession of the head, a
fourth of the body, and many rejoiced in being
so fortunate as to be able to screw off a toe
nail, or punch out one of his teeth; and on
the strength of this some forty different towns
and cities have raised most magnificent mausolea,
bearing these excruciating words, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Here
Snooks Died!</span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have enjoyed a great degree of
fame indeed,&rdquo; remarked Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the connoisseur; &ldquo;and
although he has shared the fate of many, who,
though popular when living, get pulled to pieces
immediately they are dead, his reputation has
only increased by it. Now, gentlemen, let me
show you this painting. It is a sea piece, you
will observe, and possesses all that amazing
freshness and transparency, and&mdash;and&mdash;what
d&rsquo;ye call &rsquo;em, which is considered so admirable
by the best judges. You may actually feel the
moisture of the water, gentlemen, if you stay
long enough; and that is the reason I put my
hat on whenever I look at it, to prevent catching
cold. Poor Tipple! his was a different fate from
that of the immortal Snooks. No one thought
of disputing about the honour of his birth or
burial. He enjoyed no post mortem&mdash;post
mortem?&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;he enjoyed no post
mortem gratifications. The nails were left upon
his unhappy toes, and the teeth remained undisturbed
in his miserable jaws. But he was a
great artist,&mdash;who could paint water as he did?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
None! There was a sort of an indescribable,
inimitable&mdash;and&mdash;and a whatso&rsquo;name in his
water, that nobody else&rsquo;s water ever looked
like. You could see your face in it, Sir. But
somehow or other while he was&mdash;not a hewer
of wood&mdash;but a drawer of water, whether the
sight of such a pure, sweet, refreshing beverage
made him continually thirsty, I&rsquo;m not certain,
but he drank, gentlemen, not his own water,
even when he drew it ever so mild, but strong
waters, till they overpowered his weak constitution,
got into his upper story by an hydraulic&mdash;hydraulic?
Yes, that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;by an
hydraulic power of their own, till he created a
deluge in his own body, without the use of
colours, which spoiled his palate, and made him
obliged to brush. Ah! Tipple was a great artist.
There was a sort of a truth, a nature, a thingembob
about every thing he attempted, which
gave to all his paintings a certain, a&mdash;you
understand, which is perfectly delightful to look
upon. He has not been appreciated by his cotempop&mdash;contompo&mdash;contempo&mdash;confound
it,
I forget the word, but however he was not appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by somebody. But perhaps, like me,
he looked to posterity; and although he has not
created a Posthumous museum, as some of his
best productions form a portion of its invaluable
contents, it is very possible that when posterity
does me justice it will not forget the merits of
Tipple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Posthumous had detailed at sufficient
length his description of the contents of his
library, he led the two friends into a suite of
several rooms, not at all suitable for the purpose
for which they had been erected, in which
objects in natural history were arranged, if arrangement
it might be called, for here were
animals, vegetables, minerals, and fossils, mingled
together as if they belonged to the same family,
but the specimens, like those in the library,
were every one imperfect&mdash;they were all deficient
in something or other, which rendered
them comparatively useless to the student and
valueless to the collector. This defect, however,
was not observed by the owner, who imagined
that there was not a collection in the
world that could boast of so many unique specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from the stores of nature and art, as the
Posthumous museum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, gentlemen, before you, the
wonders of nature, from a tadpole to an elephant!&rdquo;
exclaimed the manufacturer, in a tone
of exultation. &ldquo;I have collected these&mdash;I
have collected them for the benefit of posterity,
and not without considerable expense and labour,
as you may believe. But when a man is
excited into action&mdash;yes, excited into action&mdash;by
an idea so comprehensive, so universal&mdash;so
whatso&rsquo;name, as forming a museum for the benefit
of posterity, he thinks not of the trouble
to which he may be put, or the money he may
be out of pocket, when he is endeavouring to
develope&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;endeavouring to
develope his own philosophical conceptions.
Well&mdash;this is an&mdash;this is a&mdash;this is an animal
of some kind, but the name I do not at present
remember. You can at once perceive how much
it differs from all other animals: in the first
place, it has four legs&mdash;two behind and two
before&mdash;an extraordinary coincidence&mdash;coincidence?
Yes, that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;and it possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a tail, which, marvellous as it may seem, is invariably
placed upon the rump of the animal, and
as nearly opposite to its head as head and tail
can be. Now you will notice the head. It
has, you see&mdash;two jaws, one above and the
other below; and, though it may appear strange,
the upper jaw never sinks below the under jaw
even if the poor beast be ever so chap-fallen&mdash;and
the under never rises above the upper jaw.
Very curious that. That animal, you will observe
by the teeth&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how though,
is carnivorous&mdash;carnivorous? Yes, that&rsquo;s the
word, which means that it eats nothing but
grass. It&rsquo;s called by zoologists one of the roomy&mdash;roomy&mdash;roomy&mdash;one
of the roomy something,
but I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can remember
what&mdash;and I suppose it is because it requires
a sort of an expanse&mdash;an extensive, a&mdash;whatdyecallem,
to move about in. Now <em>this</em> animal
is a different species altogether. It is what
they call a&mdash;you understand. It has the same
number of legs, the same number of tails, and
the same number of heads as the other animal,
and yet their natures are entirely, absolutely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and something else which I&rsquo;ve forgot, different.
Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful? This is a grani&mdash;yes, a
granivorous quadruped, and consequently eats
flesh, mutton chops, beef steaks, or anything
else of the same sort. You see these hoofs,
how admirably adapted they are for tearing
their prey, much better than knives and forks,
when they, under the influence of a certain
impulse or instinct, or whatso&rsquo;name, roam about
the wilds looking after their eatables. Wonderful,
isn&rsquo;t it? Both these animals belong to
the class mammalia; yes&mdash;mammalia&mdash;a word
that signifies that their mothers are called
mammies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You quite enlighten me on the subject,&rdquo;
observed Oriel Porphyry, endeavouring to suppress
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Sir, I&rsquo;ve studied it for a very long
length of time,&rdquo; replied his host. &ldquo;I know it
thoroughly, you may depend upon it. Now,
Sir, here is a fish. Fishes swim, you know,
Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was aware of that,&rdquo; remarked Oriel, as
gravely as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t swim when they&rsquo;re dead,
Sir,&rdquo; rejoined the manufacturer, as if desirous
of making his auditors wonder at the extraordinary
fact. &ldquo;Curious phenomenon&mdash;phenomenon?
Yes, that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;curious phenomenon
that. Well, this fish is dead, and were
you to try ever so, you could not induce it to
swim. You will observe that it has scales.
Now the animals we have just examined have
no scales. Singular, isn&rsquo;t it? That peculiarity
in its organiza&mdash;organi&mdash;organ something,
which I have forgot, is a wise provision of nature&mdash;a
sort of whatsoname to prevent the
fish from getting wet through when exposed to
the continual action of the watery element&mdash;yes,
of the watery element. So these scales
are very important in its animal economy&mdash;ay,
animal economy&mdash;and you will remember, as a
remarkable coincidence that completely proves
the value of these things, that Justice is always
represented with scales, Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; replied both the young men
in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this is a reptile, you will observe,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
said Posthumous, pointing to a small snake in
a glass case. &ldquo;This has scales, and yet it is
not a fish. Strange, isn&rsquo;t it? Here&rsquo;s the
name. It is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bipède cannelé</i>. The first
word signifies that it&rsquo;s a biped, like man,
though it&rsquo;s got no legs; and the other word
denotes that it&rsquo;s found in canals. Here are
some shells: this one is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coriocella nigra</i>,
because it always frequents the cellars of the
blacks; and this is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Velutina capulöidea</i>,
the first word of which means that it was discovered
by Veluti, a chonchologist&mdash;a chonchologist?&mdash;yes,
a chonchologist, celebrated
in his day for the ardour with which he investigated&mdash;I
mean the spirit with which he
penetrated&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s not it; but, at any
rate, it was a peculiar whatso&rsquo;name with
which he made his researches; and what the
other word implies I am not quite certain; but
it appears by the last syllables to mean some
low idea which it isn&rsquo;t worth inquiring into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are these things?&rdquo; inquired
Zabra, looking at a confused mass of insects
lying together in a case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are the Chalcididæ,&rdquo; replied the
manufacturer, reading from a paper affixed to
it; &ldquo;a family of hymenopterous insects, which
the heathens made sacred to their god Hymen,
because they were very much given to the
marriage state; and this belongs to the section
Pupivora, because they are always found upon
puppies. You will observe that they have
wings, and these wings are used for flying. But
all insects have not got wings, consequently
some of them cannot fly. Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?
As I said before, it is a wise provision of nature
to give them a sort of a facility&mdash;a convenience&mdash;a
thingembob, for the purpose of more
easily transporting them from place to place.
Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What bird is this?&rdquo; asked Oriel, pointing
to a stuffed specimen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! now you will observe another extraordinary
thing,&rdquo; exclaimed his host. &ldquo;This
creature also possesses wings, and yet it is not
an insect. Marvellous coincidence! This is
one of the Agami, so called because it is considered
excellent game; and has the scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psophia crepitans</i>, from its fondness of
creeping upon sofas. You observe that this
animal has but two legs: the first animals we
noticed had four, and the fish had none; yet
all of them, by that sort of natural a&mdash;you
understand, are enabled to go about wherever
they like, and indulge themselves in every kind
of&mdash;something I don&rsquo;t remember, according to
their individual capacities&mdash;their individual
capacities?&mdash;yes, their individual capacities.
Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray what stones are these?&rdquo; inquired
Zabra, directing attention to two or three
large fragments of stone leaning against the
wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not stones, but fossils,&rdquo; replied
Posthumous, trying to look amazingly sagacious;
&ldquo;and the difference between a stone
and a fossil is a&mdash;the difference between a
fossil and a stone. Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed his visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see it is very hard,&rdquo; continued their
companion, &ldquo;and has the skeleton of an animal
long since extinct&mdash;extinct? yes, extinct&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>long
since extinct, plainly marked upon it. It
is said that, once upon a time, long before I
can remember, there was a shower of rain
came down, that not only wetted every one to
the skin, in spite of their umbrellas, but
actually drowned all the animals in the world,
except those&mdash;yes, except those who were not
drowned. Well, the poor things when they
were dead couldn&rsquo;t move in the least; and, in
course of time, by the continual deposit of&mdash;of
whatso&rsquo;name upon their bodies, they became
squeezed into the earth round about
them, and that becoming hard, they became
hard also. Now these are minerals. The earth,
you know, is made like a bread and butter
pudding; a layer of bread and butter, then a
layer of currants, and so on; in what are called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strata</i>&mdash;yes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strata</i>, because they&rsquo;re always
straight;&mdash;and sometimes they find coal, and
sometimes stone, and sometimes clay, and
sometimes something I don&rsquo;t remember, and
sometimes something I have forgot; and all
these things are kept together in their proper
places by a sort of&mdash;you understand&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
holds the world firmly together, so that people
may walk upon it without fear of its tumbling
to pieces. Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way Posthumous proceeded describing
to his visitors the contents of his museum.
Every object was noticed, and all relating to it
he knew, which appeared at all times more novel
than authentic, was minutely detailed, with a
look and a manner marked by self-approbation
and stupidity, that were exceedingly amusing,
till the hour arrived for dinner; when he
seemed, with considerable reluctance, to leave
its many attractions, and led the way into a
dining-room, which was also crammed with
every species of antiquity he had considered
sufficiently valuable for his collection, where,
with a mummy at his feet, and a statue without
a head at his elbow, he did the honours of hospitality,
mingling them with liberal allusions
to the benefit he was intent upon doing posterity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CONVERSAZIONE.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening, and every part of the Posthumous
museum was brilliantly lit up and filled
with visitors. The manufacturer gave a conversazione,
and his rooms were filled with some
of the most celebrated characters in the world
of wealth, fashion, and literature of Sydney.
Some turned over the leaves of books&mdash;others
looked through portfolios of prints&mdash;some examined
the paintings&mdash;and others scrutinised
the antiquities&mdash;a few appeared intent upon
studying the appearances of the different specimens
of natural history, and others seemed
equally desirous of becoming acquainted with
the disposition of their companions. Some in
little circles were arguing upon various subjects,
and in a room by themselves were a more select<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
party enjoying the performance of some excellent
music. Posthumous did not seem on terms of
intimacy with many of his guests, for they passed
him with as much indifference as if he was some
one not worthy to be known; but he was remarkably
attentive to Oriel and his companion,
describing, as they passed along, the different
persons that crowded his rooms, and only occasionally
stopping in his remarks to exchange
a few words with some of his visitors with whom
he knew he might be familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see that person before you in the brown
and yellow thingembob, with a long nose and a
remarkable sort of a whatso&rsquo;name in his appearance,&rdquo;
said Posthumous. The two friends saw
who was meant, but did not recognise him by
the description. &ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s examining that
Chinese idol. He&rsquo;s a clever man&mdash;decidedly
a clever man. He lived most part of his life in
China, because, he said, the country always
suited him to a T; and has written ever so many
books about its geography and use of the globes,
habits, customs, laws, antiquities, and something
else I don&rsquo;t remember. He says their chronolo&mdash;chronology?&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
chronology, that&rsquo;s the
word&mdash;he says their chronology is the most
ancient in the world; but I&rsquo;ll be bound to say
that there&rsquo;s a more ancient chronology in my
museum, only I can&rsquo;t tell exactly where to lay
my hands upon it. But a very learned writer
is Chopstick&mdash;very learned. It was he who
discovered that the tea-plant was originally cultivated
in England, as he found there a river
called <i>Tees</i>, and ascertained that the ancient
name of the people was <i>Celtæ</i>, so called from
their selling teas. That little man in the
snuff-coloured&mdash;you understand, knows more
about antiquities than any body in Australia.
It was he who proved so clearly that our city
was originally built by Sir Philip Sydney, an
architect who was very partial to erecting arcades,
so much so that he wrote a work about them
called Arcadia, and from him our metropolis has
derived its name. Talking of antiquities, do
you know I met in a book the other day something
about a psychological&mdash;psychological?
yes, that was the word&mdash;something about a
psychological curiosity; and although I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
offered any price for a psychological curiosity,
I have not been able to procure one. But let
us hear what Dustofages is saying about that
piece of ancient brickwork. It has an inscription
upon it which has puzzled me completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Posthumous and his young visitors approached
the table on which rested a considerable piece
of brickwork that had attracted the attention of
the little antiquarian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tolerably certain,&rdquo; said Dustofages
with a grave face, to a few anxious students of
the art in which he was so famous, that thronged
near him, &ldquo;I am tolerably certain that this
inscription is in the English language, and from
its appearance I should pronounce it to be cotemporaneous
with the Georgian dynasty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; murmured Posthumous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first three letters are evidently a T, an
R, and a Y, which make the word <span class="f8">TRY</span>,&rdquo; continued
the antiquarian: &ldquo;and the letters of the
next word, though nearly obliterated, taken together,
form the name <span class="smcap">Warrens</span>&mdash;and this
ancient inscription, therefore, is &lsquo;Try Warrens&rsquo;&mdash;but
what it means I am not so confident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Perhaps this Warrens was a notorious offender
whom the people wished to have tried and
punished; and therefore expressed their wishes
in a conspicuous manner, that the government
might notice it, and <em>try Warrens</em>: this was a
way the populace then had of making their sentiments
known to their rulers as may be ascertained
by an antique fragment in the Australian
Museum, on which is inscribed the words,
&lsquo;Down with the Whigs!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; exclaimed Posthumous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as in the whole course of my reading
I have met with no allusion to any notorious
character of the name of Warrens,&rdquo; continued
the little man, &ldquo;it is quite as probable that
some obscure individual made the inscription as
a sort of memento to attract the attention of his
mistress, expressive of his love and fidelity&mdash;he
wished her to <em>try Warrens</em>. In the English
anthology, from a very ancient poem, I met
with these lines, addressed by a lover to his
mistress&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Try me, try me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove ere you deny me&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">which proves that lovers were desirous of being
tried; and as so many inscriptions exist in which
the ancients showed their attachment to their
females by inscriptions on wood and stone, declaring
their wishes, there can be but little
doubt that these words were placed here by
some enamoured youth who was desirous that
a particular female, whose name has not come
down to us, should &lsquo;Try Warrens.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo; cried the delighted
Posthumous, and without waiting for an answer
hurried his companions to another room. &ldquo;How
do you do, Bluey?&rdquo; he exclaimed, addressing
a tall thin lady with a bilious complexion, who
appeared to be examining some minerals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather say, how does my will do,&rdquo; replied the
lady, very gravely; &ldquo;for it is my will that does
every thing. I must have the will to do, before
the action can be done. If you mean merely
to inquire into the state of the mere animal
machine, I must reply, that of the chemical
combinations now in process, the acids overpower
the alkalis, and produce an acetous fermentation
in the natural laboratory, that disturbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the sanatory functions of my particular
system, and tends to create new combinations
injurious in their action upon the animal fibre;
but as I know that as a sufficient proportion
of the earthy salts, either in carbonates or sulphates,
held in solution, or in any other form
that may be most convenient, operating upon
the acids, will counteract their unhealthy tendency
and render them inert, I do not care for
the disorder of my organic substances. It is
not of sufficient importance to distract my attention
from the interesting study of chemical
affinities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re so bad,&rdquo; remarked
the inquirer, in a tone of regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad is the antagonist of good,&rdquo; said the
lady, sharply; &ldquo;and I beg to say that I am not
bad. Bad is evil&mdash;I am not evil&mdash;therefore I
am not bad. Bad is base&mdash;I am not base&mdash;therefore
I am not bad. In fact, bad is a very
unphilosophical term to apply upon such an
occasion. You should have said that you regretted
that there should exist any chemical
combinations in my system of natural processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that support life, which are not characteristic of
a state of health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, I hope you will soon get better,&rdquo;
responded her host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better is worse than bad,&rdquo; replied his guest
with additional severity. &ldquo;To be better, implies
an antecedent state of badness, and I tell
you again I am not bad, I have not been bad,
and I do not intend to be bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good bye&mdash;good bye,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
attempting to hurry away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no sense in the phrase &lsquo;good
bye;&rsquo; it means nothing,&rdquo; said the lady hastily:
&ldquo;it is an abbreviation of &lsquo;good be with you.&rsquo;
Now, if you mean to say that I am good, I
deny it. I deny that I am either good or bad;
good and bad being qualities not existing in
the object, for what appears good to one may
seem bad to another; but they arise in the
idea of the individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Posthumous and his companions were glad
when they were out of hearing of the lady,
whose metaphysics and chemistry they could
not appreciate in the way she desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, do you see that tall man behind his
whiskers?&rdquo; inquired the manufacturer, pointing
to a person who answered to such a description.
&ldquo;He has got a very remarkable,
stately sort of whatso&rsquo;name, hasn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;s
a member of the government, a great patron of
literature and science, and&mdash;and something I
forget. He&rsquo;s been known to spend as much as
sixpence a week in the cheap publications; and
many a miserable starving author, who has sent
him his works, he has actually enriched with
his good wishes. Great patron, isn&rsquo;t he? The
person he&rsquo;s talking to in the beautiful head of
hair, is a political writer on the ministerial side,
who has a wonderful, incomprehensible&mdash;a&mdash;you
understand, that&rsquo;s very delightful. He
writes about the glorious constitution, our admirable
government, and&mdash;and something with
a fine name I don&rsquo;t remember, in a style that&rsquo;s
absolutely, completely, and downright thingembob.
That lady, that seems to be looking after
her youth and beauty, is the authoress of a
work which has been very popular, called,
&lsquo;The whole Duty of Man,&rsquo; which is filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
long chapters upon short commons or fasting,
praying, sneezing, the cultivation of carrots and
virtue, the bringing up children and mustard
and cress, and directions about paying bills and
visits. The young man, trying to admire himself
in the glass, is a novelist famous for the
splendour of his imaginative conceptions&mdash;yes,
of his imaginative conceptions. His books
are like the rooms of a dealer in fashionable
furniture; or-molu and mother-of-pearl, rosewood
and ivory, buhl and something I forget,
meet one in every page; and he writes about
gold, and silver, and precious stones, as if he
had been an apprentice to a jeweller. Then
his stories are always celebrated for a certain
pathetic whatso&rsquo;name, which is much admired.
Now let us go into the music room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three associates passed through the
crowd which filled the rooms to the great danger
of the more breakable antiquities, Posthumous
stopping occasionally to talk to one or
welcome another, till they arrived in the music
room, where they took some refreshments as
they entered. A beautiful girl was accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
herself while singing the following
words, to which all seemed to listen with the
greatest attention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lunar tide began to flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tidal wave moved to and fro,<br /></span>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; cried a dozen voices in a
breath, as soon as the song was concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So exquisitely pathetic!&rdquo; murmured one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So perfectly natural!&rdquo; exclaimed another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is admirable; is it not, sir?&rdquo; said a
young lady with a remarkable pair of languishing
eyes, as she directed their eloquent gaze
full upon the handsome face of Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it is, madam, if you think so,&rdquo;
replied the merchant&rsquo;s son, with more politeness
than sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! our opinions are the same&mdash;the
effect of a mutual sympathy. How charming!&rdquo;
observed the young beauty languidly. &ldquo;Do
you believe in the theory of mutual sympathies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confess I know nothing about it,&rdquo;
acknowledged Oriel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Innocence exemplified!&rdquo; exclaimed his
companion, regarding him with more evident
admiration. &ldquo;I will explain it to you. There
exists in every human creature in one sex a
decided inclination towards some human creature
in the other sex, which is never developed
till those two meet together, and then it immediately
becomes manifest. Now suppose, for
example, I possess a certain amicable feeling,
which remains perfectly unknown until I
meet with you for the first time, when an immediate
consciousness tells me that my sympathy
is excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Posthumous.</p>

<p>Oriel was at a loss what to reply; but Zabra&rsquo;s
dark eyes appeared flashing with indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, these sympathies ought to be indulged;
or why are they created?&rdquo; asked the
fair sophist. &ldquo;If we observe nature, which is
always the best guide, we shall find all her
impulses followed out to their purpose, to the
great increase of the pleasures of the individual.
Nature never can be wrong; therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
if we follow nature, we shall always be
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so!&rdquo; responded the manufacturer.
&ldquo;I remember seeing a puppy running
after his own tail, and he was delighted at the
fun. Yes, follow nature, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry with great difficulty refrained
from laughing. Zabra, on the contrary, looked
upon the young lady with an expression of
scorn that made his countenance appear darker
than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a conviction of the truth of this
theory that made me write my work on the
philosophy of mutual communion,&rdquo; continued
their companion, &ldquo;where you will find proved,
by arguments that cannot be confuted, that
there is no happiness in the world except in
love&mdash;that love is this mutual sympathy between
two individuals of the two sexes&mdash;and
that this sympathy should invariably be indulged
as often as it exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have always had something of the
same notion about love,&rdquo; remarked Posthumous,
gravely. &ldquo;I consider love to be a sort of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
very beautiful, interesting&mdash;a&mdash;you understand,
in one person, for a peculiar, charming,
delightful&mdash;a&mdash;whatsoname in another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should imagine, from what I have observed,
that the true nature of love is perfectly
unknown to either of you,&rdquo; observed Zabra,
with some asperity; &ldquo;it only dwells in the
breasts of those whose qualities assimilate with
its own. It is the principle of truth, of purity,
and of excellence; and whomsoever it touches
it makes true, and pure, and excellent in the
eyes of the lover. There is wisdom in it; for
wisdom is ever an emanation of truth. There
is beauty in it; for beauty is the essential spirit
of purity. And there is in it an omnipotent
power; for in excellence will always be found
the greatest degree of greatness. Love, being
true, enlightens; being pure, sanctifies; and
being excellent, strengthens all by whom it is
possessed. It is a virtue from which all virtues
proceed. It is the nobility of nature. It is the
humanity of life. Without it the sun would be
black, and the heavens a void; a strife would
be among all things, and a devouring death consume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the universe. With it the power of a
perfecting will fills the glad heart; and in
whatever corner of the earth there breathes the
principle of existence, love will enter into its
most secret depths; infuse into them a purpose
hitherto unknown; fill them with a power to
suffer and to conquer that cannot be set aside,
and render the individual, the atmosphere he
inhales, and all things he sees, touches, or
hears, the receptacle of a perfect felicity, that
endures even unto the very threshold of oblivion.
It is this feeling, and this feeling alone,
that has created whatever is admirable around
us; we admire, because we love; and we love,
only to produce a continuation of the qualities
we have admired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel regarded the animated countenance of
his youthful companion with his usual affection.
The young lady gazed upon his beautiful features
with apparently more sympathy than his
friend had excited; and Posthumous opened
his mouth, rubbed his eyes, and stared, and
looked all the wonder and admiration his foolish
face was capable of expressing; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he did find language, which was not for some
minutes after the speaker had concluded, he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that&rsquo;s exactly what I said. It is
nothing in the world more than a simple, a&mdash;something
I have forgot, arising entirely in the
organisation of the individual&mdash;organisation of
the individual?&mdash;yes, organisation of the individual,
that produces a peculiar sort of feeling
in the a&mdash;whatsoname.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE PHILANTHROPIST IN TROUBLE.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Oriel</span> Porphyry made a considerable stay in
Australia, visiting most of the principal cities,
the manufacturing and agricultural districts, in
fact, whatever part of the country was considered
most worthy of notice; bartering his
merchandise, and making purchases of such
articles of traffic as might be advantageously
disposed of during his voyage. Before he left
the country he received from his father the following
communication:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope by this time, my dear Oriel, you
are completely reconciled to the way of life I
wish you to follow, and I am quite sure that
the longer you live the more cause you will
have to rejoice at pursuing a path so honourable.
Every day I exist, I the more fervently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
congratulate myself upon having forsaken the
deceitful splendour of a false ambition, for
wherever I look around among those who belong
to that undeservedly honoured section of society
I was forced to leave in disgust, I observe so
much of envy, inquietude, pride, folly, hatred,
ignorance, ambition, and tyranny, I wonder
that such things the prejudices of custom
can regard with homage. I see the title of
majesty applied to an individual who is the very
reverse of majestic; his highness is diminutive;
his grace awkward; a fellow, though he be
a notorious cheat, may still be a nobleman; and
however unworthy or ignorant be a person of
rank, he is allowed to take precedence of virtue,
of intellect, and of every species of human excellence,
undistinguished by the title he possesses.
I do not mean to assert that a man
is in any way the worse for having this sort of
distinction, for I have found many real noble
men among our aristocracy; what I maintain
is, that they are in no way exalted by it. And
when I compare the good effected by this class
with the good effected by those who do not belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to it, the disproportion is so immense that
I must always call in question the advantage of
maintaining a section of society in an acknowledged
state of superiority to the rest, who, to
the rest, are of so little utility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next thing to be considered is&mdash;are
they a happier race of individuals than those
whom they think beneath them? Most of them
are in the enjoyment of many luxuries; but
luxury and happiness are far from being synonymous:
and when we come to look into
the artificial state of life in which these people
exist, and notice their exclusiveness, their rivalries,
their ostentatious splendour, and their
prodigal meannesses, we can afford them only a
low place on the scale of happiness&mdash;one certainly
much beneath that possessed by persons
whom they are in the habit of thinking their
inferiors. Yet this is the sort of greatness,
Oriel, you seemed so desirous of possessing.
That desire, I hope, has given place to better
and nobler aspirations. There is a wider field
now open to you; from which the landscape
shows every attraction which ought to allure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
you forward. Go on, Oriel, go on and prosper.
Let me see you a philanthropist, and I shall die
content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been some stirring doings in
Columbia since you left the country. Our
rulers seem desperately intent upon working
their own destruction. I regret this. I regret
it for the sake of these inconsiderate men&mdash;I
regret it more for the sake of the community at
large, who, if they are driven into open opposition
and strife, and bloodshed ensue, must be
the immediate sufferers. Public meetings have
been held in various parts of the empire, particularly
in the northern provinces, and resolutions
reflecting very strongly upon the ministers
have been agreed to in the presence of immense
multitudes of the people. Some disturbances
have taken place, which were put down only at
the sacrifice of several lives, and many of the
most influential of the public prints, notwithstanding
the ruinous prosecutions, fines, and
imprisonments, with which all who advocated
the cause of the people are punished, denounced
the measures of the government in a very bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
tone. The meetings in the metropolis were
equally important, and their proceedings were
conducted with a similar degree of energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the highest municipal officer&mdash;as a
legislator of considerable experience, independent
of my reputation as a private individual, I
naturally enjoyed much influence among my
fellow-citizens. They looked up to me for advice,
and were always anxious for my countenance.
It was with great uneasiness that I observed
the mischievous policy pursued by the
Emperor&rsquo;s advisers. I saw that its tendency
was to fill the hearts of the people with a spirit
of resistance, that must eventually lead to a fierce
and relentless civil war, that might deluge the
country with blood, and destroy its prosperity
by the withering blast of flame and the sword.
What to do in this fearful crisis was not a subject
to be dismissed without deep reflection.
To its consideration I gave anxious days and
sleepless nights. I knew that, if the existing
feeling continued, a struggle would commence
that could not easily be stopped; it would
continue while there was hope on one side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
power on the other; and to the true patriot
there can be nothing so horrible as the prospect
of a savage warfare around him, in which the
children of the same soil must be set to slaughter
one another. On the other hand, it was equally
evident that, if the government were allowed to
carry on their despotic proceedings, every citizen
would be obliged to give up the privilege
of his manhood, and become a slave; and I had
so much of the mighty impulses of freedom in
my nature as would not allow me to look
tamely on, while the chains were riveting
around my subjected country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that there was but one way to secure
my fellow-countrymen from the approaching
degradation without having recourse to
deeds of violence. From my place in the legislature
I continually described the alarming state
of the empire, and foretold the fearful consequences
which must result if ministers proceeded
in the course they were pursuing. With all
the eloquence of which I was master, I implored
them to desist. I entreated that the
obnoxious measures might be abandoned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
offered to become security for the immediate
return of the public tranquillity if the desire I
expressed was complied with. At the same
time, whenever I was called upon to direct or
attend a popular assembly, which was almost
daily, I strongly advised the propriety of refraining
from violence. I recommended continual
public meetings, in which the voice of
the nation might be spoken without intemperance;
and that the ministers might be made
sufficiently aware of the state of opinion, I
advocated the policy of petitioning the legislature
for redress, in firm but respectful language,
throughout every part of the united empire.
The government paid no attention to my labours.
I was listened to with inattention, and
my arguments were treated with disdain. Proud
in the use of a slavish and corrupt majority,
proud in the exercise of a power they wished
to render irresponsible, and proud in the possession
of an immense standing army, whose
services they retained by profligate expenditure
of the public money, they attempted to stifle
the voice of opinion, by constant endeavours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to prevent the meetings of the people, and by
treating their petitions with studied contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The effect these proceedings had upon me
I leave you to imagine. I never could have
supposed any set of men could have been found
so indifferent to their own interests. But the
emperor resolved to render his power absolute,
and his advisers had urged the necessity of
pursuing what they called strong measures,
arguing that, if they stopped now at the
clamour that had been raised, it would be
impossible for them to resume their measures
at any future time. In vain I preached patience
and resignation, peace and temperance. Prosecutions
and persecutions were going on in every
direction. The presses that laboured to diffuse
among the people a knowledge of their true
situation were seized and destroyed, and the
persons connected with them were incarcerated
in dungeons; private dwellings were invaded,
on the most frivolous pretexts, in search of
imaginary conspiracies, and their inmates were
subjected to every kind of indignity&mdash;mulcted
in heavy penalties, or carried off from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
homes and never more heard of; spies appeared
to lurk in every house; and no sooner was a
public meeting announced than measures were
taken to prevent its being held, by filling the
place with heavily armed troops. My anxiety
grew more intense every day. I saw the storm
must burst; I knew that the strife must begin;
and when I beheld the almost countless masses
of military that filled the country, ready to act
on the first emergency, and knew that they
would oppose men undisciplined and imperfectly
armed, I shuddered at the mere anticipation of
the consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among those who took a part with me in
opposing, in a constitutional manner, the proceedings
of the government, might be found
many of the most enlightened, the most admirable,
and the most wealthy men in the empire;
men whose characters were unimpeachable, and
whose property formed an important stake in
the country; and they were earnest in their
philanthropy, and sincere in their patriotism.
They agreed with me in opinion that peace
ought to be preserved till they were absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
forced to take up arms. But there were others
amongst us, young and headstrong politicians,
or crafty and deceitful spies, who appeared
most anxious to provoke an immediate collision.
That the strife was about to commence
was the general impression, for many provided
themselves with arms, and others endeavoured
to secure their property. This state of things
continued from day to day, creating the most
tyrannical laws, and making the indignation
more general. All expected a blow to be
struck; but having no acknowledged leader,
and no settled plan of action, none were ready
to strike. At last, as a final resource, I thought
of once more calling a public meeting; and to
avoid its being prevented by the government, as
others had been, it was kept secret among
known friends till the last moment, when each
communicated it to a separate circle with such
excellent effect, that the assembly was one of
the most crowded that had ever been held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my duty to open the business of the
day. Much as I feared the coming warfare,
knowing that success could only be gained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the expense of incalculable misery and suffering,
I felt the painful truth that the end justified
the means, and endeavoured to prepare
myself, as well as my excited feelings would
allow me, to take my share in the approaching
struggle. I abhor bloodshed; from my heart
and soul I loathe it. I would have sacrificed
myself willingly to obtain justice for my fellow-citizens;
but justice seemed a thing only to be
procured by force. I addressed the meeting.
I felt that the labours of a long life, endured
to create a more general happiness, were about
to be risked in a strife of brother against
brother. All that I had endeavoured to avoid
would now become unavoidable&mdash;the reign of
discord would commence&mdash;the wounds I had
healed would break out afresh&mdash;the good I
had done would be turned to evil&mdash;the felicity
I had created would end in wretchedness. With
these convictions of the mind, the sympathies
of the heart may easily be imagined. I at first
addressed the meeting as if mourning at the
funeral of my own hopes. I related all that
had been endured, and the eyes of my attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
auditors seemed to burn with indignation, and
their brows scowled with resentment. I described
the patience with which all had been
endured, and their looks were restless and
gloomy. I detailed every instance of contempt
with which that patience had been regarded,
and the breasts of the strong men heaved with
passion, and their glances were stern and fierce.
I told them how much I lamented the blindness
and obstinacy of their rulers, and showed
them the deep and just cause I had for that
regret; but having stated that all had been
attempted that the most patriotic philanthropist
could have suggested to escape unshackled from
the evils with which we were threatened, I told
them that nothing now was to be done to preserve
our liberties but to maintain them by
force of arms. Twenty thousand eager voices,
joining in one continued cheer, testified their
readiness to follow the suggestion. &lsquo;A long
life has been devoted to your service,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;whose greatest pleasure has been created by
the pleasures it has been enabled to diffuse. I
would much rather that the life had been prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to continue its enjoyment in the same
gladdening labour; but our rulers have willed
it otherwise. I cannot end my existence as hitherto
it has proceeded&mdash;not in the sweet indulgence
of my friendly feelings towards my species&mdash;not
in the observance of the tranquil bliss
they have produced. No matter! I have ever
been devoted to your service; my life must end
in pursuing the same duty. I will stand by
you in the struggle you must now commence;
and all the power and wealth and influence I
possess shall aid you in obtaining its successful
issue.&rsquo; Cheers rent the air&mdash;such cheers as,
if they had heard them, and seen the immense
multitude from whom they proceeded, emulating
each other in the expression of their
grateful enthusiasm, would have made our
ministers glad on any terms to undo the mischievous
work they had executed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many influential persons spoke to the same
effect; and it was agreed that as large a body
of men as could be got together should go to
the emperor&rsquo;s palace, and desire the instant
abrogation of the unpopular edicts. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
met with force, it was to be resisted; and as
soon as the struggle became inevitable, the
bells of the different churches were to be rung
to arms, and a simultaneous attack made on all
the military positions, so as to prevent the
troops leaving their barracks while the emperor&rsquo;s
palace was stormed. This plan was no
sooner agreed upon than it was resolved to be
put in immediate execution, to prevent the
government taking measures to prevent its success;
and a general rendezvous having been
appointed, every man left the meeting with the
intention of preparing himself for the fray. I
had returned home, melancholy, I must acknowledge;
for I could not reflect upon the
dangers to which the mass of my fellow-citizens
would soon be exposed without feelings of the
deepest anguish; and I had scarcely crossed
my own threshold before I saw that the place
was filled and surrounded by armed men, by
whom I was immediately seized, treated with
every indignity, dragged through the streets to
a dungeon, and, after having been loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
heavy chains, there left to the contemplation of
darkness and filth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The promptness and secrecy of my seizure
I had not expected, or I should have been prepared
for resistance; and now I had but little
hope of ever being of the slightest service to
any individual; for if my friends succeeded in
their exertions, they knew not the place where
I was confined, and were not likely during my
existence to discover it, so that my prospect
was but a cheerless one. It was some hours
before I could distinguish with any accuracy
the features of my prison. At last, when my
eyes got used to the darkness, I noticed that it
was a narrow cell, built of huge masses of
stone. On one side, at the top, was a small
grating of iron, through which sufficient light
entered to make the darkness evident. The
door was of iron, and it opened inwardly. The
floor was of stone, damp and cold. It was about
seven feet by five in size, and about ten feet in
height. The place seemed never to have been
cleansed: it was fouled with every abomination,
and vermin, toads, and other loathsome objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
abounded within its walls. Disgusting as such
a place must be to one used to comfort and
convenience, I began to grow careless of its
horrors, and thought only of the effect my incarceration
would have upon my fellow-citizens.
It was not so secretly done as to prevent all
knowledge of the transaction, and the few to
whom it was known, I knew would lose no
time in making their intelligence public. There
would then, I felt convinced, commence a desperate
struggle; and which ever side had the
victory, it could not be gained but at the expense
of a degree of human suffering, the imagination
of which filled me with pain and fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While engaged in these thoughts, I heard
footsteps approaching&mdash;they stopped at the
door&mdash;the strong bolts were undrawn, and a
man, muffled up in a large cloak and high
slouched hat, entered the cell. He stopped
before me. I thought he was going to put me
to death. I could see nothing of his face but
two large dark eyes glaring upon me with a
malignity I should have thought it impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
any human being could feel. He spoke, and
I knew the voice. It was Philadelphia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So ho, old plotter of treason!&rsquo; he exclaimed
exultingly, &lsquo;you are now in safe keeping,
I think. Nothing would serve your plebeian
soul but to hatch rebellion. You could leave
your beggarly buying and selling to plot the
overthrow of the state. You thought, doubtless,
it would be an easy matter to exterminate the
power of the government, and felt assured you
should have but little difficulty in seating yourself
upon the throne of the Emperor. Ha ha!
A fine plot truly: and a most admirable successor
you would make to our gracious monarch.
But I had due notice of your infamous designs.
I have watched you long, old traitor! and only
waited an opportunity for putting an end to
your ambitious career. The object I sought is
accomplished. How like you this dungeon?
it is not exactly the palace you expected. And
these chains, they are not so comfortable as the
robe of state with which you imagined your
vulgar limbs would be adorned?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly the dungeon is not agreeable, and
the chains do feel rather heavy,&rdquo; said I, mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be satisfied,&rsquo; replied he in a tone of mockery;
&lsquo;you will get used to them, and they
will last your time. I came to gratify myself
by observing how you bore this sudden change
in your fortunes. You are tired of lamenting
your miserable fate; you have exhausted your
imprecations upon me and my coadjutors in the
government; you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Common sense forbid that I should curse
myself or any one, for it could do no one any
good, and might do myself harm,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis all hypocrisy!&rsquo; exclaimed Philadelphia,
&lsquo;your heart is now ready to burst with
vexation&mdash;your soul is full of hatred&mdash;your
mind is intent upon revenge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you wrong me,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt, I do,&rsquo; he added with a sneer.
&lsquo;You are very much wronged. You are quite
a martyr to your patriotic intentions. Never
was man so ill used. Perhaps you are not a
traitor&mdash;possibly you are not a rebel&mdash;it may
be you did not treacherously plot the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the peace of my family, by aiding in
the elopement of my daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A traitor I certainly am not&mdash;a rebel I am
not&mdash;and as for your daughter&rsquo;s elopement, I
know no more than public rumour has declared,
which was, that she left your house to avoid a
marriage you were attempting to bring about
against her inclinations,&rdquo; I responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a lie! &rsquo;Tis a low, vulgar, designing lie!&rsquo;
shouted the enraged noble, as part of his cloak
falling from his face disclosed his proud features
distorted by passion. &lsquo;You have been scheming
to bring about an alliance between Eureka
and your son&mdash;a base hound, unfit to breathe
in her presence. Tell me where she is&mdash;tell
me where you have secreted her; and wherever
she may be, I will tear her limb from limb,
rather than allow her to disgrace herself by any
connection with your accursed family.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not her asylum,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But I
acknowledge I did wish that our children should
be united.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how dared you so presume?&rsquo; fiercely
inquired he. &lsquo;Could you not have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
among your own vile money-getting crew some
fit companion for your cub, that you must needs
think of uniting him with a daughter of one of
the noblest families in the empire? The world
is indeed in a sorry condition if it can tolerate
such things. But that you know where she is
concealed I am assured, and I will have the
secret out of you, if torture can force it from
your custody. Your nerves shall be racked,
your flesh lacerated; you shall starve, and die,
and rot in this hole.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been standing before him supporting
my chains, as well as I could, and listening
unmoved to his angry speeches; but there now
appeared such a remorseless cruelty in his
countenance, that I gazed in astonishment,
almost doubting the possibility that the lamb I
had known could have become so wolfish. To
have told him my real name, I plainly perceived,
would only incense him the more. If he hated
me at that moment (and I grieved to think he
should regard me with such unsocial feelings),
with such a disposition as he possessed, he would
detest me a thousandfold more, when he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
how much I could injure him. I can safely
say I had no such inclination; and had I been
so inclined, which I gladly affirm was not the
case, being so entirely in his power, I saw that
any intimation of such intentions would only
have the effect of hastening my destruction, or
of adding to my discomfort; I therefore still retained
my secret. He had folded his arms
across his breast, and was looking sternly upon
my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then you will not acquaint me with the
place of Eureka&rsquo;s concealment?&rsquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could not acquaint you with it if I would,
for it is unknown to me,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;and this
I have already told you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will crush it out of you,&rsquo; he savagely
muttered. &lsquo;Think not of ever being carried
alive out of this place. Dream not of rescue.
I have taken care that the swinish mob you
were so desirous of leading shall be cut to pieces
by the soldiery wherever they appear in arms.
Horse and foot are ready to act at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, and the most destructive artillery command
all the principal streets, and defend every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
important building. I defy the whole city; and
the first attempt at disturbance shall be so punished,
that the poor deluded fools who are left
alive will be very glad to gain the shelter of
their homes. Anticipate no assistance from
that quarter. The short time you have to live
will be passed here, where you can see no
human being, and no human being can see
you; where your shrieks cannot be heard, were
you to split your heart in the attempt. Enjoy
yourself as you can; prolong your existence
<em>if</em> you can; but, if you are wise, you will strive
to escape the death prepared for you by dashing
your traitorous scull against the wall.&rsquo; Then
fixing on me a threatening scowl, he strode out
of the cell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who could have supposed this possible?&rsquo;
thought I: how strange it seemed that the
child I had known so innocent, and so affectionate,
should have become so guilty and ferocious
a man. <em>Man!</em> it libelled human nature
to call him by the name. He was a mere animal,
and the worst of animals; for he gave
himself up to the indulgence of his passions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and pride and prejudice, and ignorance and
cruelty, and all the tribe of evil influences
which arose from an engrossing selfishness,
became the principal ingredients of his nature.
How I regretted this! I never yet saw a human
being pursuing a path which led to misery, but
I regretted the blindness that made him so
obstinately bent on punishing himself: for I
am quite certain that he who wilfully produces
suffering in another must eventually be made
to experience the pain he has created. No one
can erect his own happiness upon so wretched
a foundation, without finding the superstructure
give way, till it leave him grovelling in the very
wretchedness upon which he ventured to build.
I therefore regret that he should possess such
evil inclinations, as must make him a scourge to
himself and others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hours passed on; the evening approached;
and, not having tasted food since the morning,
I naturally felt desirous of some refreshment.
But no one came near me. I began to listen
for approaching footsteps; but I heard nothing
but a confused rumbling sound, which vibrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
through the prison. The desire for food increased
during the night. I tried to sleep; but
the inconvenience of my chains, the coldness
and filth of the floor, and a sensation of gnawing
at the stomach, made the enjoyment of sleep
impossible. I walked about; but the heavy
irons hurt my legs, and they soon fatigued me
too much to be endured. I leaned against the
wall for support, as I began to feel faint and
sick. &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;it is not intended
that I should be left here to famish?&rsquo; I could
not think so ill of any of my fellow creatures as
to imagine that they would designedly allow me
to die the lingering and terrible death of starvation.
But no one approached my cell, and it
was noon of the second day. To the pangs of
hunger were added the torments of thirst: my
tongue and throat became parched, and my skin
dry as a cinder. Still I thought that my jailors
had forgotten me. Towards evening, the sufferings
I experienced were almost unendurable:
I had pains in every limb; I felt weak as a
child, and my skin was burning hot. I endeavoured
to think of some plan by which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
might draw my attention from the agony I endured;
and fancied that, if I could bring my mind
to the contemplation of the happiness I had
been enabled to create, I should forget the worst
part of my sufferings. So I attempted to remember
every instance in which I had fortunately
been the means of securing the enjoyments
of some fellow creature; and, going back
as far as my memory could trace, I recalled the
recollection of a poor old blind man, whom,
when a boy, I had met sitting on a bank,
weeping and moaning, with the dead body of
his faithful dog, the companion and guide of all
his travels, in his lap. I had with me a beautiful
spaniel, of which I was particularly fond; and,
when I heard the poor man lamenting, in a tone
that melted me to tears, that the death of his
dog had left him helpless and forlorn, I comforted
him as well as I could. I undid the string
that was affixed to the dead animal, and fastened
it to the collar of my own little favourite; gave
him all the money I had about me, and promised
to bury his old companion very carefully in a
corner of my garden. To say that he was grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
would be to make use of too weak a term: his
delight appeared to me extraordinary. He wept
more than ever; and the fervour of his blessing
is as fresh upon my ear, after the lapse of
more than half a century, as it was when first
uttered. From this commencement I proceeded
through a long list of similar remembrances,
each accompanied by a thousand pleasurable
associations, till I found myself regardless of
the terrible wants that had so long been preying
on my vitals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had noticed that the only sounds I had
heard during my confinement had seemed gradually
to approach the building I inhabited.
Louder and louder they reverberated through
the massive walls; and at last I was enabled to
distinguish the deep roar of artillery, that appeared
to shake the prison to its foundations.
&lsquo;The struggle has commenced,&rsquo; thought I: &lsquo;blood
is flowing like water; the relentless sword is
ploughing its way through the flesh of my fellow-citizens,
and thousands are being shattered
and pierced by showers of murderous balls and
shells.&rsquo; If the words of that fierce man were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
true, their chances of success, I knew, could be
but slight. &lsquo;They are being slaughtered like
sheep,&rsquo; I cried; and every concussion produced
by the report of the thundering cannon made
me shudder with fear. All night the conflict
proceeded. I had sunk exhausted upon the
floor. I could remember nothing; I could
think of nothing. I was rapidly sinking into
insensibility, in the early part of the morning,
when I became roused by hearing the uproar of
cannon and musketry, and the shouts of infuriated
men, so near, that I was convinced that
the people had attacked the prison. I felt the
concussion of the artillery most distinctly, which
sounded as if the besiegers were battering down
the walls; and the continued burst of volleys of
musketry was evidence of the spirit with which
the attack was carried on. About an hour
passed without the slightest cessation of the
tumult,&mdash;and to me it was an age of agonising
suspense,&mdash;when the firing slackened; but
whether the attacking party had been beaten
off, or had gained possession of the building, I
knew not. Some minutes, which seemed hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
passed; and I thought I could distinguish voices
approaching. In a moment, I heard them distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are you, my benefactor?&rsquo; shouted
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Speak to us, my preserver!&rsquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Porphyry! Porphyry, our friend, we come
to your rescue!&rsquo; exclaimed a dozen others;
and I could hear them traversing the prison in
every direction in search of me. My heart was
so full at the kindness of these good men, that,
had my strength been unimpaired, I could not
have uttered a word; and I allowed my deliverers
to pass the door without attempting to communicate
to them the place of my concealment. A
few moments passed, and they again approached.
My heart beat more rapidly. I tried to husband
all my remaining strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Porphyry! Porphyry!&rsquo; shouted a hundred
anxious voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Porphyry! Porphyry!&rsquo; was echoed in
every cell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here, my friends!&rsquo; I exclaimed, as loudly
as my feebleness would allow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is him!&rsquo; they all cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know his voice among a thousand,&rsquo; said
one; &lsquo;and I am certain it came from within
this chamber.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Down with the door!&rsquo; shouted others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment a thousand hammers seemed
to be vigorously driven against the door. The
men cheered each other on in the labour:
each exerted all his force; and in a few
seconds the heavy bolts were shivered to
splinters, and, with a piercing hurra! a crowd
of eager friends burst into the cell. As soon
as they saw my condition, their hearts were filled
with commiseration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t a place to turn a dog in,&rsquo; said one,
indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The miscreants!&rsquo; muttered another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look at these terrible chains!&rsquo; cried a
third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The tyrants!&rsquo; exclaimed several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us carry him from this miserable hole;
he is too weak to move,&rsquo; said a man whom
I had befriended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will bear a hand: he rescued me from
a prison!&rsquo; exclaimed one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I: he saved me from ruin,&rsquo; shouted
another. And by these grateful creatures I
was carefully carried into the open air, with
my chains still about me, and in the wretched
plight in which I had been found; where, on
being shown to the multitudes of armed citizens
that thronged the streets, I was received
with shouts of triumph mingled with imprecations
on my oppressors; and, accompanied by
an escort of a hundred thousand men, I was
conveyed in safety to my own house; my chains
were taken off; and the most skilful physicians
being immediately in attendance, I rapidly recovered
to my usual state of health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ascertained that, as soon as my seizure
became known, the church bells were rung to
arms, the stones in the streets were torn up,
and barricades, which served to block up the
thoroughfare from the advance of horse, and as
intrenchments from which a galling fire could
be poured upon the approaching troops, were
formed across the streets. The first day, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
there was great slaughter on both sides,
no important advantage was gained by either
party; and at night the soldiery remained under
arms, and the people were busily employed in
preparing to renew the conflict. Leaders were
appointed of tens, of hundreds, and of thousands;
and the grand point of attack was the
arsenal and the ammunition magazines; while,
at the same time, the military were kept sufficiently
employed at all the posts they occupied.
After a most obstinate resistance, the arsenal
was carried; and the arms there found soon
obtained owners willing to use them. Ammunition
was acquired in a similar manner; and
the result of these attacks gave to the popular
cause a vast accession of strength. The barracks
of the military, and the prison in which
political offenders were incarcerated, were
next sought out. The object of the attack
on the former was to harass the soldiery as
much as possible; and the aim of the latter
was to find out my concealment, for the purpose
of effecting my liberation. It was impossible
to exceed the enthusiasm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
people when approaching the places where
they imagined I was confined. They shouted
my name, and rushed through the thickest fire
with a valour that nothing could resist. Many
of the prisons were pulled down after a fruitless
search for the object they sought; and then
they proceeded from these to others, till the
day was spent. It was found impossible to approach
the palace, as a chain of posts was
established all round it, supported by an immense
strength of artillery and powerful bodies
of horse and foot, from which the citizens had
been several times repulsed during the day;
but at night, when the tired soldiery were endeavouring
to snatch that repose which two
days&rsquo; constant fighting rendered necessary, a
simultaneous attack was made at every available
point by a countless myriad of armed
citizens; and, although they obtained possession
of many pieces of cannon, after fighting
desperately till daybreak, they found themselves
compelled to retreat, with very considerable loss.
After this, it was resolved to draw a line of
strong intrenchments round this chain of posts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
so as to prevent any communication or supplies
reaching them from other parts of the city, or
from the surrounding country, and then to
crush in detail the resistance that might be
offered at other positions; and this plan was
being put in practice when my concealment
was discovered, and I was set at liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The knowledge of the treatment I had received,
while it inflamed the hearts of my
countrymen, created for me even a more powerful
sympathy than I had previously excited.
As soon as I was able to attend to what was
going forward, the leading men of the movement
waited upon me, and communicated all that had
transpired since my imprisonment; and, after
assuring me that the enemy must surrender in
a few days, or, if they moved from their position,
be cut to pieces, they stated that they were
commissioned by the people to offer me the
chief authority of the nation, under whatever
name or character I should judge most beneficial
to the state. I need scarcely add that I refused
the flattering gift. I did more; I told them
the many attempts the late Emperor had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to force on me his distinctions, and their result.
I told them that my object had been to live
as a private individual, endeavouring to effect
among my fellow men as much good as I had
the power to create; that I had lived happily
as one of themselves, and, as one of themselves,
I wished happily to die. I told them that, as
far as my advice and assistance could tend to
their advantage, they might always command
them. I endeavoured to prove to them the
danger of changing the form of government,
without being prepared with a better; and
strived to convince them that it was much more
to the interest of humanity, and to the advantage
of the citizens, not to drive to desperation the
powerful army still remaining, to which they
were opposed; but, with the superiority they
possessed, to attempt to bring about an adjustment
of the quarrel between the government
and the people, on such terms as should leave
the latter nothing to desire, and the former no
power to tyrannise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My suggestions were not received with the
cordiality which they deserved. The deputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
talked of the merciless slaughter of the citizens&mdash;the
cruelty that had been exercised upon
me&mdash;and the necessity of making an example
of the offenders. I answered, that it would only
be treading in the steps of our oppressors by
desiring vengeance for injuries&mdash;that those
who had been wronged could receive no benefit
by the death of those who had injured them&mdash;that
the evils the government had committed
could not be remedied by their destruction&mdash;and
that it was the most unwise policy a community
could follow, to punish an offence that
had been committed by taking a life, for it made
it impossible that the offender should ever make
amends to society for the mischief done. &lsquo;Prevent
as effectively as possible,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the
evil doer from repeating a wrong, and let him,
by the exercise of virtuous inclinations among
the community, outweigh the evil he has effected,
and you will do more good than has been
done by punishment since the creation of the
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regretted to observe a disinclination to
follow my advice. The hearts of my companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
seemed filled with resentment, and their minds
with prejudice. Again they pressed on me the
offers of the people, and again I refused; and
then they took their leave of me, expressing
their intention of acquainting the citizens with
my resolution. I was most anxiously desirous
that the warfare should terminate; and, knowing
that the time was opportune for exacting the
most favourable conditions for the nation from
the government, I was eager to bring about an
accommodation. The mass of my countrymen
I found too much heated by the conflict to listen
with a proper feeling to the peaceful measures
it was my aim to accomplish. Arms were still
in their hands, and the blood of their friends
still stained the public streets. I published my
sentiments among them in the most convincing
form of which I was master; and, in addition to
the opinions I have already stated, I offered, if
they would intrust me with the office, to act as
mediator, having powers to effect an arrangement
between the contending parties on such
conditions as would secure the liberties of the
people on the most firm and enlarged basis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
reduce the influence of the crown to an extent
which would not be dangerous to the community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five days had elapsed since the contest
commenced; and the troops were hemmed in
around the palace, deprived of sufficient provisions,
and harassed in every way that the
valour and ingenuity of the citizens could devise.
The ministers had now become as humble as
they had before been intolerant. They attempted
to bring about a reconciliation. They offered
largely, and promised more. There they were,
in the midst of sixty thousand picked men,
trembling for the consequences of their own
misgovernment; for they saw that the whole
country was in the hands of the citizens, and
that it would be impossible much longer to
continue a resistance. Hitherto all their efforts
at accommodation had been treated with studied
indifference; but, having succeeded in procuring
from the people the office I desired, I immediately
set about communicating with the government
the only terms upon which peace could be
restored; and these were, that the ministers by
whom the Emperor had been advised in his late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
measures should be banished from the court&mdash;never
again to exert any authority over the
people&mdash;and that half their estates should be
confiscated to the relations of those who had
perished in the conflict&mdash;that the Emperor
should grant a charter to the people, by which
all the privileges of freemen&mdash;right of opinion&mdash;liberty
of conscience&mdash;a perfect representation
of the popular will&mdash;unshackled trade&mdash;a
liberal patronage of genius and industry&mdash;and
the abolition of oppressive taxes and undeserved
pensions should be preserved to them
and their posterity for ever&mdash;that a standing
army, beyond what was necessary to maintain
security from foreign invasion, should no longer
exist&mdash;and that no attempt should be made by
the Crown either to punish any citizen who had
assisted in the late struggle, or to repossess itself
of the power which had been found so dangerous
to the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose these conditions seemed hard;
for some days elapsed, and frequent attempts
were made to have them rendered more agreeable.
Not only did I refuse to alter them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the slightest degree, but I at last gave them
four and twenty hours for consideration, at
which time, if they were not accepted, I stated
that I should insist upon unconditional surrender.
Before the day was over, the conditions
were agreed to&mdash;the charter signed and sworn
to by the Emperor, in the presence of an almost
countless multitude of citizens&mdash;the ministers,
among whom, of course, was that unpitying man,
Philadelphia, were banished from the city; half
their estates were confiscated, and a new and more
liberal administration chosen in their place&mdash;and,
as the intelligence extended from one end
of this mighty empire to the other, nothing was
heard but sounds of congratulation and gladness,
of thankfulness for the past, and hope for the
future. All that I had desired was accomplished.
The marks of the recent strife were soon erased.
The citizens, returning to their social duties,
ceased to think of the wounds they had received
and inflicted; and all the blessings of peace
began to flow in their accustomed channels.
Had the struggle continued with the design of
overpowering all opposition, and changing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
form of government, the war would have been
resumed in the provinces; might have been prolonged
from father to son in efforts to restore
the fallen dynasty; and, as a change, when attempted
in a settled form of government, always
produces an unsettled state of the public mind,
the country would have been continually disturbed,
and the happiness of the people rendered
exceedingly insecure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Columbia are satisfied with my exertions:
they acknowledge the worth of what
I have done. Even the Emperor seems desirous
of paying me attention; and, although I
have not much faith in his sincerity, his conduct
serves to keep up the harmony which prevails.
And, by my refusal to accept power at
the expense of the happiness of my fellow-citizens,
I have now the gratification of seeing
the country prosperous, the people enjoying
a greater degree of liberty than they have known
for centuries, and the whole population vying
with each other to show their estimation of my
services. There is one thing that gives me peculiar
satisfaction; and that is, your absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from the country at this eventful period. I
know that, had you been here, your impetuous
spirit would have hurried you into every wild
and rash undertaking, and that you would have
effected more mischief in a day than I should
ever have been enabled to efface. Proceed with
your voyage, Oriel, and when you return you
will have reason to rejoice at the change which
has been produced during your absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry had read the preceding communication
with intense interest; every moment
stopping to regret that he should have been so
far away at a period so important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, had I but been there!&rdquo; he exclaimed
at the conclusion. &ldquo;Here is a golden opportunity
lost! The very moment for which I
have so anxiously looked has escaped me. The
great battle has been fought, and I not in the
field. Surely, such a disappointment is enough
to make one curse one&rsquo;s destiny. My father&rsquo;s
notions are too chimerical. He is good&mdash;ay,
the very best among the good; but his spirit is
not young enough for the age. He should have
crushed the hydra when he had it at his feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Had I but been there! He will find, too late,
that it is no use patching things that are radically
bad: they cannot be mended; they
are worn out, rotten, and useless. And that
proud tyrant to have used him so inhumanly!
Had I but been there! What a field there was
for exertion, what splendid opportunities for
daring valour! Perhaps a body of two hundred
thousand armed citizens, all eager, all desperate,
wanting only a leader to make them
irresistible. Oh, this wretched fate, that kept
me here like an inactive slave, while glory is to
be won by a mere effort! And he was offered
the supreme authority, and refused it? Noble,
but unwise. He could confer more good on
the people in a year than this thing, called an
Emperor, can effect during the whole of his useless
existence. Now the time is gone. The
renown after which I yearn, the distinction and
the power, would have been mine, had I been
in the place where it might have been acquired.
Had I but been there! How long am I to
carry on this profitless existence? How long
must I be forced to stifle my own energies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
live, from day to day, in the same dull round
of inactivity? Must the wings of that spirit,
that soars so far above the unambitious herd,
still continue to be pinioned, leaving me to
crawl upon the earth, following out the same
ignoble purposes as those around me? Oh, deplorable
fate! The rock to which Prometheus
was chained, and the bird that pierced his vitals,
are but types of the barrenness of my prospects,
and the disappointed hopes that prey upon my
peace. Oh, wretched destiny! The thirst with
which Tantalus was devoured was a blessing,
compared with the curse with which I am tormented.
Eureka! Eureka! The greatness I
have desired so earnestly, to make me more
worthy of your excellence, has been waiting
for my eager grasp, while I was far, far from
its reach. Oh, had I but been there!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VI" id="CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">CHINA, ITS LAWS, CUSTOMS, AND PEOPLE.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Albatross was just entering the Chinese
sea, and making way in gallant style through
the heavy waves. Her crew were numerous,
and of picked men, chosen at the different
ports at which the ship had touched since her
departure from the pirates&rsquo; haunt on the Madagascar
coast, by the experienced judgment of
Captain Hearty. Several promotions had taken
place among the old hands. Climberkin, who
had distinguished himself on many occasions as
a brave and skilful seaman, became second in
command. Boggle, though liable to confuse
his understanding with abstract speculations,
was always to be depended upon in an emergency,
and was honest, persevering, and well
acquainted with the management of a ship at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sea, and he was made second lieutenant. Loop
was created a midshipman. Oriel Porphyry
had offered to settle Ardent in comfortable circumstances
in his native country; but he stated
that having lost all that made dear to him the
land of his birth, and having found so many
kind friends on board the Albatross, he should
prefer remaining in the vessel in any capacity
in which he could be of service, and as he was
known to be well qualified for the office, to him
were assigned the duties of purser and captain&rsquo;s
clerk. As for Roly Poly, the offer of an empire
would not have induced him to resign the
custody of the roast and boiled; and he therefore
continued absolute and undisputed sovereign
of the cook-house. He seemed to be
getting fatter every day. His back appeared
to bend beneath the load of flesh it carried,
and his huge black cheeks had become so large
as to threaten to close up his eyes. To gain
his good opinion, nothing was necessary but to
praise his cookery; but as soon as any poor
fellow attempted to find fault with the viands,
or the way in which they were dressed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
abuse he received for what was considered his
presumption and ignorance, made him glad to
make his peace with the indignant cook upon
any terms. For all this Roly Poly was held in
much estimation by his shipmates. The important
service he rendered with his mop was
not forgotten; and though he was continually
relating in a manner peculiarly his own, the
way in which he had served out &ldquo;dat ignorant
jackmorass who sulted him by telling
diclus impossumbilities,&rdquo; the story was invariably
received with the same hearty laugh and
boisterous praise that marked the first hearing.</p>

<p>Although the manners of Captain Hearty
and his officers were rather unpolished, the
education which was common to all Columbians,
and the experience they had gained in their
profession, made them perfectly qualified to
fulfil the duties they had undertaken; and the
ship was as skilfully navigated, as if under the
superintendence of the most gentlemanly officers
in the service. As has before been stated,
the commercial character of the Albatross had
been changed by skilful hands for one of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
threatening aspect, nor was the alteration at all
displeasing to the taste of Oriel. The only
pleasure he seemed to enjoy with any zest, was
in seeing the men exercised at the guns, practising
at a mark, or engaged in improving themselves
in the use of the broadsword; and in
these pursuits he would join with intense interest,
encouraging those who seemed anxious
to excel, and rewarding those who evinced the
most skill. His satisfaction at the arming of
the vessel was increased when he considered the
possibility of being attacked by pirates in the
different seas that lay in the ship&rsquo;s course, who
might easily, as Captain Death and his associates
had done, have made themselves masters
of the Albatross; but who would now find it
a matter very difficult to be accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come Zabra, I am plagued to death by
my own thoughts. Cheer me with a song:&rdquo;
said Oriel Porphyry to his young friend as they
sat together in the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you shall have, Oriel,&rdquo; replied the
handsome musician, as his hand ran lightly over
the chords of the harp; &ldquo;and I will try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
humour your martial feelings to keep you in
good temper with yourself. Listen to</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s glorious, &rsquo;tis a noble strain!&rdquo;
exclaimed Oriel, while his brilliant eyes flashed
with excitement; &ldquo;a strain fit to stir the heart
to noble deeds. I feel my soul thrilled with an
heroic spirit that would do battle even with the
fierce enemy&mdash;Death! Give me a fair field
and a good cause&mdash;a band of warlike brothers
moved by the same mighty impulse as that by
which I am now excited&mdash;and let us have fit
weapons and enough of them, and we would
sweep the oppressors of the world from the
earth, like rotten reeds before a whirlwind.
Wisely did the ancients honour their bards
above all human greatness. Well was it that
they gave them precedence and dignity and
wealth in abundance&mdash;the gold chain round
the neck, and the seat of honour near the
throne. If they possessed but the power you
have evinced, they were worthy of the first
place and the richest gifts: for they must have
been the leading spirits of the age&mdash;the
movers of armies&mdash;the winners of triumph.
What nature, with the common energies of
manhood, could resist such a stimulus? Stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
walls, the crushing iron, and the penetrating
steel&mdash;would these be as obstacles in its way?
Straws! Had I lived in those days, the leader
of a warlike generation, and heard a song such
as you have sung, I should have felt inclined to
have exalted the bard above my own dignity,
knowing that his influence upon the dispositions
over which I ruled could be rendered far more
effective for the purposes that gave me supremacy,
than my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expected it would move you in some
measure,&rdquo; said Zabra, gazing with affectionate
interest upon the flushed cheek of his
patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move me! would a mælstrom move me?&rdquo;
cried the young merchant. &ldquo;It seems to
have stirred the sluggish blood in every hidden
vein and artery. My brain throbs as if it would
move up the scalp in which it is confined, and
the pulsations of my heart appear to have acquired
the action of a boiling torrent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have done mischief,&rdquo; observed
the musician anxiously; &ldquo;I did not count upon
producing so violent an effect. Let me undo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the evil I have created by singing to you some
lyric of an opposite tendency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where got you this power?&rdquo; asked his
companion, fixing a searching glance upon the
lustrous eyes before him. &ldquo;By what means
gained you the rare art which you practise with
such wondrous effect? Your&rsquo;s is no common
skill for the ignorant to admire; it is an influence
which the most tutored in worldly wisdom
must feel and worship. You never could have
gained it while employed in the laborious idleness
of a page. You are too young to have
acquired it by study. What mystery is this
you have gathered around you which gives you
such a mastery over the affections of your
associates?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slight tremor passed over the graceful
form of the young musician: his eyes shrunk
before the earnest gaze of Oriel Porphyry, and,
shaded by their long dark lashes, were fixed
upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you;&rdquo; said he at length. &ldquo;Although
great care was taken with my education,
from a very early age I was left much to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
own inclinations; and being gifted with an
extraordinary love for knowledge, and a rare
facility in its acquirement, and a powerful
tendency towards that knowledge which was
most ennobling, I rapidly obtained a degree of
intelligence which was rarely found even in a
more mature period of life. There were two
particular objects of study to which I for years
dedicated an intense degree of attention: these
were music and poetry. Music was a source
of the most exquisite gratification to me at all
times, and I applied diligently to make myself
master of all its difficulties. In this, after
constant application, superintended by the best
masters, I succeeded, so as to be able to create
at pleasure any effect I was desirous of producing.
In the study of poetry I had no
teachers, excepting the only teacher capable
of giving instruction&mdash;Nature. I went amid
the stir of leaves in the heart of the primeval
forest; I stood beneath the dazzling glances of
the countless eyes of heaven; I looked down
upon the waters of the great deep, till I knew
how to interpret its mighty voices; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
whisper of the wind to the blushing flower
became to me a lesson full of an exquisite and
impressive eloquence. There was not a sound
in the air&mdash;a light upon the skies&mdash;a splendour
on the earth&mdash;or a motion in the sea,
that did not assist me in my study; for there
were beauty and truth and power; and these
are the constituents of all natural poetry. But
there was something still wanting to breathe
the spirit of life into the new conceptions that
had been created in my nature. This I found;
and from that time there has been a gladness
in what I knew, and a purpose in what I did.
Now let me remove the too powerful impression
I have produced, by something more in accordance
with my own sympathies. You shall hear
&lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Song to his Mistress.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A symphony, full of the most touching interest,
preceded a melody so impassioned, yet
so sweet in its expression, and harmonised in so
rich and masterly a manner, that the young
merchant had soon all his faculties engaged in
deep and earnest attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;That I should love thee is not strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For excellence doth love create;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that my love should die or change<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can never be&mdash;&rsquo;tis not in Fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as thy worth, in heaven&rsquo;s bright view,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must ever hold its glorious stature;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not that bliss which from it grew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Partake of its immortal nature?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Nor can exist a taint of schism<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, like the colours in the prism,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They cannot change, they never fade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus is it, then, sweet friend! my love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From thy fond worth Time ne&rsquo;er can sever;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must a natural goodness prove:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Things made from gold are sterling ever.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the conclusion of this song, which Zabra
sang with a thrilling pathos which must have
reached the heart of his auditor, the two friends
were interrupted by a message from the captain,
to acquaint Oriel that a pilot had come on
board to conduct the vessel up the river to
Canton; and that if he wished to observe the
Chinese coast, there was now an excellent opportunity.
All thought of poetry and music seemed
forgotten for the time; for the musician and the
young merchant immediately hastened upon deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Albatross was passing Macao, and steering
her course towards Whampoa; and a group
were on the quarter-deck noticing the appearance
of the country, the junks and other strange
vessels they were passing, and making observations
upon what they saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are approaching a people,&rdquo; said Fortyfolios,
&ldquo;who, if they are not the most ancient
that exist, lay claim to an antiquity of which
few could boast. They are the most extraordinary
race on the globe, and the most unchangeable
in their habits. Though they
preceded the rest of the world in the march
of civilisation; though they invented the arts
of printing, and of manufacturing silk fabrics
and porcelain goods; though they discovered
the composition of gunpowder and the use of
the magnetic compass; they have never progressed
beyond these advances. Thousands of
years have passed&mdash;nations that were not then
in existence, in intelligence have left them far
behind&mdash;and still they remain exactly as they
were, and are not only indifferent to the improvements
around them, but look upon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
other nations as barbarians unworthy of their
association. In vain have they been conquered:
conquest could make no change in their habits
or opinions. Among the most celebrated of
their masters were the Manchews, a people
doubtless so called from their attachment to
cannibalism, by whom they were held in subjection
for several centuries; and the English,
who made a conquest of their empire when in
the zenith of their greatness. Their subjugation
by the latter was caused by their own pride and
insolence. The Chinese were so impressed with
an opinion of their own superior greatness, that
they behaved to all foreigners who visited their
shores for the purposes of traffic with humiliating
insolence. They were only allowed to
trade at one port, their merchandise was subjected
to the most arbitrary duties, and their
merchants were treated with every kind of
insult. This was borne for a considerable
period by the mercantile world, in consideration
of the importance of their commerce, and
the impossibility of finding their exports in
other countries. But toleration only increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the audacity of the Chinese authorities. They
proceeded to acts of violence: several vessels
were plundered, and their crews were murdered,
or carried away, and never heard of after. At
last the English, having endured this treatment
without being able to procure the slightest redress,
determined on retaliation. From their
possessions in India they invaded the Chinese
territory with a powerful army, and at the same
time ravaged their coasts with a naval armament
that destroyed their shipping, plundered
their towns, and laid their defences in ashes.
The Chinese, as cowardly as they had been
insolent, though possessed of an immense population
and extraordinary resources, made but a
feeble resistance, and were glad to purchase
peace upon any terms they could make; but the
English had discovered the weakness of their
enemy, and had not forgotten the oppressions
they had endured, and did not desist from the
conflict till they had annexed the mighty empire
of China to their immense dominions in India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All very true,&rdquo; added Tourniquet. &ldquo;They
were ignorant, bigoted, and slavish, but for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that they were the most prosperous nation under
the sun, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their prosperity was occasioned by the
laws by which they were governed,&rdquo; said the
professor. &ldquo;Industry was encouraged. Agriculture
was pursued as the most honourable
occupation, as one in which the emperor delighted;
and obedience was inculcated as the
first duty of a citizen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what was the spirit of their laws?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every father of a family was despotic in
his own household: the emperor was regarded
by his subjects with the same reverence that a
family looked up to its domestic ruler; and an
offence against the monarch was punished in a
similar manner as an offence against the parent;&rdquo;
replied Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine no state of things so arbitrary
and so contrary to common sense, don&rsquo;t
you see;&rdquo; observed the doctor. &ldquo;By such a
law, whether a man be a drunkard or a profligate,
a fool or a knave, he has unlimited supremacy
over his offspring; he can punish with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
death when he pleases, and the poor wretches
who acknowledge his relationship, dare not
murmur. He is a father; and fatherhood,
like charity, covereth a multitude of sins. There
is nothing so ridiculous as this notion. No
individual in the great family of nature is entitled
to the slightest respect, unless he is respectable
in his conduct. All relationship is
an accident. A father has no right to the obedience
of his child, because he is his father:
that can only be the most absurd of claims; for
he produced the child to please himself, and at
the time could have no sympathy towards an
object that was not in existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be disputed;&rdquo; replied the professor.
&ldquo;But I must maintain, that obedience
in a child, to a reasonable extent, ought to exist
as a natural consequence of the care and anxiety
of parentage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted, with the limitations;&rdquo; said the
surgeon. &ldquo;When a father brings up his child
with a proper affection, affection from the offspring
ought to be expected; but in no case
has the parent a right to implicit obedience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
unless he has so acted, and the law he wishes
to make absolute is such as will not affect the
welfare of the child. In many instances the
son possesses more intelligence than the father;
and yet, if parental subjugation were allowed,
the wise must be held in subjection by the
opinion of the ignorant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should imagine such a form of government
likely to be very ancient;&rdquo; observed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unquestionably of great antiquity,
and derived from the patriarchal ages, when
the oldest member of the family held supreme
authority over the rest;&rdquo; responded Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About as much as the ocean has originated
from the drops of rain that fell from the sky,
don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; added the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain that the progenitors of the
Chinese were a nomadic race;&rdquo; said the professor
rather sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted; and what then?&rdquo; inquired the
surgeon, in his usual good-humoured manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That they were a collection of single families,&rdquo;
continued Fortyfolios.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So are all nations at the present time,
don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the manner which existed at the
age to which I allude;&rdquo; rejoined his antagonist.
&ldquo;Every man dwelt in his own tent, surrounded
by his children and his children&rsquo;s children, and
wandered with his herds and flocks, to wherever
he could find them sufficient pasturage. He
governed as a monarch with power of life and
death, and the rules he found necessary to preserve
his government he transmitted to his
successor; till, the family increasing, it was
found necessary that they should separate into
distinct divisions, each having its own father or
ruler, and, residing for mutual protection near
each other, they constituted tribes. The rules,
which the experience of the first father had
found necessary for maintaining his authority,
had been conveyed with modifications and additions
through his successors, till they became
possessed by the elders of the tribe, in whom
all wisdom and government resided; until the
increase of their numbers, and the want of sufficient
accommodation, induced them to invade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the more desirable territory of other tribes; and
then it was that he who distinguished himself
most in this warfare obtained supremacy over
the rest, and having conquered other tribes,
and rendered himself by his superior bravery
the object of fear and admiration, he became
king of all the people who acknowledged his rule,
and governed them by the laws that had existed
previously in his own particular family or tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very plausible hypothesis, but nothing
more, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; replied the doctor.
&ldquo;Doubtless all societies originated in one
family, the supreme head of which did what
he thought fit; but I doubt much whether he
exercised such an authority as could sacrifice a
life for an offence real or imaginary; or created
any code of laws for the government of his relations.
He did only what he thought necessary
for the time; and whether that constituted a
precedent or not, it is not easy to determine.
The punishment which would be necessary at
one time, might not be thought necessary at
another, don&rsquo;t you see. Where the judge is
absolute, and has no constitution to guide him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it is the mood in which he may be when called
upon to judge, that makes the sentence severe
or mild; and every judge, being independent of
any higher authority, and liable to act from
prejudice or partiality, would create nothing
but inconsistent decisions, which could never
be tolerated as a code of laws. It is opinion
that creates law. The heterogeneous mass of
absurdities that the few promulgate to hold the
many in subjection would not be tolerated except
in a state of perfect slavery. Where there
is any intelligence among the people, and intelligence
must make its appearance sooner or
later, every law that is found existing passes
the ordeal of public opinion, and if it be unwise
or unjust, it will not be regarded or its abrogation
will be enforced. The multitude have a
better notion of the difference between right
and wrong, than is generally supposed; and
nothing is so productive of a clearness of distinction
in these things among the people than
a proper simplicity and applicability of the laws
by which they are governed. It is intelligence
that produces opinion, don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
opinion that creates law&mdash;and law cannot long
exist in opposition to opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the disputants were intently engaged
in their argument, Oriel Porphyry and Zabra
had walked to another part of the deck, where
the captain and his lieutenant were giving orders
about the management of the vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine old country, this, captain;&rdquo; said the
young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Hearty: &ldquo;fine old
country, certainly. They do say it&rsquo;s as old as
Methusalem; but I never was in sight o&rsquo; that
coast, therefore can&rsquo;t say what difference there
may be between &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been in this part of the world
before, I should suppose?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many times,&rdquo; responded the old man: &ldquo;I
knows the place well. I&rsquo;ve been afloat ever
since I was a small craft as could hardly steer
without capsizing; and there arn&rsquo;t many seas
in the world as I haven&rsquo;t been over. John
Chinaman and I are &rsquo;ticular acquaintances, because
I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal on him. He&rsquo;s
rather smart in his own notions o&rsquo; himself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he makes a good reefer when aboard, and he&rsquo;ll
carry like a steam engine when ashore. Often
when I&rsquo;ve landed at this port from one or other
o&rsquo; your father&rsquo;s ships, I&rsquo;ve seen him bearing
sich loads as &rsquo;ould make a horse&rsquo;s back bone
unkimmen ticklish. We&rsquo;re enterin&rsquo; the river
now; and after sailing a few points west of
north, we shall be nigh upon the first bar, from
whence we must steer due west to Whampoa,
where we shall cast anchor. You&rsquo;ll have then
to go about ten miles to the Factories, to which
you must proceed in boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What strange looking ships these are;&rdquo; remarked
Zabra, pointing to several vessels they
were passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, they are very queer shaped craft,&rdquo; said
the captain. &ldquo;But John Chinaman&rsquo;s no great
shakes at ship-buildin&rsquo;, although he thinks he&rsquo;s
wonderful. Look at that heavy lumbering
junk. She looks like a great thick-headed old
muff, as does&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know his helm from his taffrail.
The Albatross would take the conceit out
o&rsquo; her in no time. And look at these here outlandish
looking barges&mdash;there&rsquo;s no sense in &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The country has rather an interesting character;&rdquo;
observed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all accordin&rsquo; to taste,&rdquo; replied Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These here islands o&rsquo; sand ar&rsquo;nt &rsquo;ticularly
lovely to my thinking; and I can&rsquo;t abide the
ugliness o&rsquo; the craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what manner do these people now behave
to foreigners?&rdquo; inquired Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it ar&rsquo;nt quite so bad as what I&rsquo;ve
read on in ancient history;&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had a sick&rsquo;ner for coming that sort
o&rsquo; fun; but they coil up their noses pretty
stiffish even now. They allow travellers to
wander about and examine their notables,
which they did&rsquo;nt use to do; but I should recommend
any fellow, who&rsquo;s more nor ordinary
&rsquo;quisitive, to look out for squalls. I have heard
say as people ha&rsquo; been missed who was axing
their way through the country; and not a spar
or a bolt-rope on &rsquo;em ever heard on again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About five years ago I was in this here part
o&rsquo; the world,&rdquo; said Climberkin, joining in the
conversation; &ldquo;and I had a very narrow escape
o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; done for in that fashion. I was bo&rsquo;sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
aboard the Whittington, a reg&rsquo;lar tip top merchantman,
as Master Porphyry had in the
China trade at that time, and after a wearisome
cruise I had been jollificating up the country
with a few mates, when I came alongside as
smart a piece o&rsquo; China ware as ever I clapped
my eyes on. Well, she did&rsquo;nt understand none
o&rsquo; my lingo, and I could&rsquo;nt circumnavigate any o&rsquo;
her&rsquo;n; but we had signals flying at our eyes like
winkin&rsquo;, and we pretty soon heaved to, and
were yard arm and yard arm, and looked at
each other till all was blue again. I discovered
that she belonged to the crew o&rsquo; a man-tea-maker&rsquo;s
&rsquo;stablishment, and got her livin&rsquo; pretty
comfortable, by alays &rsquo;turnin&rsquo; over a new leaf
(though she never did nuffin wrong to sinnify);
and so I thought as how if that was the way o&rsquo;
sailin&rsquo;, I might bring her to book wi&rsquo; her own
leave, without any botheration whatsomdever.
Just as I was making way in the business, I received
a &rsquo;munication from one o&rsquo; my mates, who
was up to their lingo, that some half a dozen
o&rsquo; the Chinamen with whom she &rsquo;sociated, were
on a reg&rsquo;lar take in about my consortin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and had entered into a &rsquo;spiracy to nail down
the hatches on my goings on. Me and my little
frigate were in the habit o&rsquo; cruisin&rsquo; in a grove
o&rsquo; prime timber, by the side o&rsquo; a rice field, and
it was here-about&rsquo;s that the man-tea-makers
thought o&rsquo; dishing me as strong as could be;
but I took care that they should meet wi&rsquo; a
mighty difference. After preparin&rsquo; every thin&rsquo;
as was necessary, I got my mates to lie in ambush,
and began a courtin&rsquo; a way in a style as
would make the jealousy rise out o&rsquo; a dead
nigger. I had&rsquo;nt been long at this here fun,
when up comes the whole lot on &rsquo;em screechin&rsquo;
like mad, and they bears down upon me threatenin&rsquo;
the most completest spiflification as you
can imagine. Their eyes flared up most immensely.
Their teeth seemed playing at knives
to grind; and they whirled about monstrous
bludgeons that would have made no bones o&rsquo;
me, had I suffered &rsquo;em to scrape my acquaintance.
My cretur struck her flag and
down she went; but before the teapots came
to close quarters, I put my bo&rsquo;sun&rsquo;s whistle
into play; and pulled out a pair of &lsquo;do-for-you&rsquo;s,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as my mates coming up and showing the same
signs o&rsquo; welcome, surrounded the poor devils
in such a way as they could&rsquo;nt move no how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do with your rivals?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel, considerably amused by the
lieutenant&rsquo;s narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d al&rsquo;ays heard it recommended to
do as you&rsquo;d be done by,&rdquo; replied Climberkin;
&ldquo;so we got the sticks from the Chinamen, and
took the flavour out on &rsquo;em in a manner as left
&rsquo;em nuffin to complain of. But we wern&rsquo;t
satisfied with such an act o&rsquo; justice. You
must know that each o&rsquo; these tea-dealers has
a tail to his head, from two to three feet long,
o&rsquo; which he is as proud as is a peacock o&rsquo; his
tail, and shaves all the rest o&rsquo; his cranium as
smooth as glass. Knowin&rsquo; this, we&rsquo;d brought
lots o&rsquo; rosin and twine; and, while some o&rsquo; our
chaps made &rsquo;em lump it if they didn&rsquo;t like it
most considerably, we spliced them all together
from the small ends down&rsquo;ards, for several
inches, strong and tight as a patent cable;
then, seeing a tree close at hand with the
loveliest fork possible for our purpose, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
hauled &rsquo;em up wi&rsquo; ropes over the branch till
half on &rsquo;em hung on one side and half on the
tother, by nuffin in the world but their own
precious tails. Didn&rsquo;t they raise a bit of a
shindy! Such howlin&rsquo;, such squallin&rsquo;&mdash;such
kickin&rsquo;, such scratchin&rsquo;&mdash;such a reg&rsquo;lar rowdy-dow
no set o&rsquo; humans ever made afore. And
there we left &rsquo;em, as the ancient poet says, wi&rsquo;
each partic&rsquo;lar hair standin&rsquo; on end, while we
crowded all sail to our own ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rather too bad of you, lieutenant,&rdquo;
said the merchant&rsquo;s son, attempting unsuccessfully
to look grave; &ldquo;and I wonder you did
not get yourself into trouble in consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it did raise a smartish bit o&rsquo; a bobbery,&rdquo;
replied Climberkin; &ldquo;but we all kept so snug
aboard, and sailed so soon arter, that not one
on us were diskivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall anchor immediately,&rdquo; said the
captain, returning to the group he had left to
speak to the pilot. &ldquo;Is it your wish, sir, to go
ashore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be at Canton without delay,&rdquo; rejoined
Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the galley, and get a boat&rsquo;s crew ready
to proceed up the river,&rdquo; shouted Hearty to the
second lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; was the ready reply; and
while the boat was lowered into the sea, and
all her appurtenances provided, Zabra and his
patron made their arrangements for landing on
the Chinese territory.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VII" id="CHAP_VII">CHAP. VII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CHINESE POET.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> an elegant room, the floor of which was
covered with clean white matting, while the
furniture, consisting principally of a divan or
sofa, mirrors, pictures, couches, Japan tables,
and large porcelain vases, was of a superior
description, cross-legged on the divan, eating
sweetmeats from a small silver saucer, richly
chased, which he held in his hand, sat a young
man, of less than the ordinary stature, with a
countenance that seemed possessed of a perpetual
melancholy. He was dressed with the
most studied effect. He wore a robe of dark
rich silk, and over it a vest of delicate blue
satin, beautifully figured. Upon his head,
which was shaved, with the exception of a
long lock of hair that hung from the crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
over the shoulder, was a small black cap of fine
felt, with the brim turned up, and the crown,
of a conical shape, covered with a fringe of
scarlet silk, having a peculiar button in front.
Below wide trowsers were seen stockings of
silk, remarkably thin, having their feet cased in
small slippers of embroidered satin; and round
his waist was a girdle, drawn very tight, to
which was appended a small gold case, a purse,
and a pouch of silk. Opposite to him sat Oriel
Porphyry and Zabra, in their usual dresses,
also eating sweetmeats from similar saucers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an ineffable felicity I enjoy in being
able to speak your language,&rdquo; observed the
young Chinese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you find it an advantage
in your communication with foreigners,&rdquo; replied
the merchant&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An advantage!&rdquo; exclaimed the other rapturously.
&ldquo;By the great Fo, &rsquo;tis the most
superlative of enjoyments. I bless the gods
that my mother was an Anglo-Indian, and that
she conferred on me the exquisite gratifications
arising from proficiency in the use of her language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
My father passed a great portion of
his life in India, and acquired a facility in
its pronunciation which is rarely obtained by
a Chinese; so that I was born with extraordinary
advantages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were fortunate, certainly,&rdquo; added
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunate! By the immaculate tail of
Confucius, I was favoured beyond all experience,&rdquo;
cried his host.</p>

<p>There being nothing more to say on that
subject, at least so the young merchant thought,
he inquired&mdash;&ldquo;Your father, I suppose, will be
here shortly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is paying his devotions at the neighbouring
temple. Long Chi enjoys a religious
reputation, and he loves the society of holy
men. But I was telling you of the indescribable
happiness I possess in having acquired a
proficiency in my mother tongue,&rdquo; added Long
Chi the younger. &ldquo;I am blest with a poetic
genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra, with some
surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful as it may appear, the fact is
what I have stated,&rdquo; replied the young poet,
putting down the silver saucer on a small japanned
table before him, and opening the pouch
at his side, from which he took a bundle of
papers. &ldquo;I may say that my compositions
have attracted an extraordinary degree of attention
in the world of letters. They are considered
phenomena in literature, I assure you.
Do not imagine I wish to overrate their value.
I should not think of such a thing for the
thousandth part of a moment; and to prove
this to you, allow me to enrapture you with
some of my effusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Oriel, expecting at least
to be amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The effort of a profound sublimity I am
about to breathe into your enlightened ears,
you will have the intellectual discrimination to
observe, is a perfect specimen of the true Anglian
pastoral,&rdquo; remarked Long Chi. &ldquo;It has
been created by that etherial sense of delicious
enjoyment which your ancient poets called love.
She for whose immaculate glorification it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
called into existence, is a combination of miraculous
excellencies&mdash;an incarnation of inconceivable
perfections; and therefore your superior
sagacities must not deem it at all more than
ordinary extraordinary, if the merits of this
indestructible conception fill you with a ravishing
amazement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what you have said I should expect
something particularly clever,&rdquo; observed Zabra,
evidently considerably amused by the poet&rsquo;s
phraseology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever!&rdquo; exclaimed the young Chinese,
with emphatic fervour. &ldquo;By the great Fo you
will find it supernaturally perfect.&rdquo; Then arranging
a rumple in his vest, and taking a glance
of satisfaction at the reflection of his person in
a large mirror beside him, with a slow and
careful enunciation of each word, and a peculiar
wave of the hand to mark the measure, the
melancholy poet read the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Have you seen my Fee Fo Fum,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;She of whom I&rsquo;m in pursuit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Budding out with five small toes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calf&rsquo;s foot, likened as a treat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a jelly it would beat:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shepherds, did she this way come?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you seen my Fee Fo Fum?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is a superlative composition,&rdquo;
remarked Zabra, attempting to conceal a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can safely say I never heard any thing
like it,&rdquo; added Oriel in a similar tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I entertained an incipient conviction that
you would find it marvellously admirable,&rdquo; replied
the poet, elevating his head, and stroking
his mustachios. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis ineffably divine, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed both, looking at
each other with a smile of peculiar meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; echoed Long Chi, raising his
voice and eyebrows. &ldquo;By the invulnerable
tail of Confucius, &rsquo;tis something for which a
name cannot be found. But exquisitely perfect
as it may be, here is a production that excels
it in the very unapproachableness of its excellence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the two friends listened with admirable
patience, the young Chinese unfolded
another paper, and read with the same gravity
these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;When first we met &rsquo;twas in the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dicky birds begin to sing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And teaches, with unaltered brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When trees take leaf, to make their boughs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I met thee passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I had thee&mdash;in my eye.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Meaning no harm, began to shoot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When beans their hollow &lsquo;shells&rsquo; would doff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marrow fats were going off;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first our hearts were growing warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I had thee&mdash;arm in arm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas autumn when we met again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sunshine parched the peas and plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When plums are blooming on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into flour would gladly fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When apples are to fritters torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth&rsquo;s square feet feel many a corn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first did I forget my fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I had thee&mdash;box my ears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I saw thee last when winter, nice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When &lsquo;cold without&rsquo; comes near and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his sweetmeats frosted are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ballot when the white balls roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unask&rsquo;d for, hastening to the poll:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I &lsquo;broke the ice,&rsquo; and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I the happiest of men.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;That exceeds the last certainly,&rdquo; said Oriel
Porphyry, amused with the perfect gravity with
which the poet read his verses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears to me quite a new style of
poetry,&rdquo; remarked Zabra, with as much seriousness
as he could assume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably! it is novel in the novelest
degree,&rdquo; replied Long Chi, smiling with all the
graciousness of gratified vanity. &ldquo;I may with
the most complete justice lay claim to be the
origin in which originated its originality. I
have studied sublimity. By the great Fo, I may
say that; and I have found the sublime in every
individual natural thing that is in nature; but
in cookery and confectionary it predominates,
as must be evident to the inquisitive investigation
of any man of taste. It is the opinion of
the most discriminative judges, that no writer
of serious poetry can compete with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that opinion every one must coincide,&rdquo;
observed Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no question on the subject,&rdquo;
added Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shall say you are barbarians, when
you exhibit such a superabundant knowledge
of the beautiful?&rdquo; exclaimed the Chinese, with
all the energy he could assume. &ldquo;I am immeasurably
enraptured to notice such an admirable
judgment; and, as an additional proof
of the satisfaction I receive from your friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
attention, I will still, to a much more infinite
extent, delight your auditory nerves with one
of the most serious of my efforts in serious
poetry. Mark the true sublime; mark it well,
and see how splendidly it agrees with the magnificent
subject. It is an ode to a sugarplum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poet unfolded another paper; and the
young merchant shrugged up his shoulders, as
he heard its contents read with the same tone
and manner as its predecessors.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;You excel yourself, sir,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry,
with something of sarcasm in the tone
of his voice, arising, perhaps, from his becoming
a little out of patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the unsophisticated tail of Confucius,
you may say that,&rdquo; replied the poet with the
same seriousness he had from the first evinced.
&ldquo;Having, in so unutterable a manner, obtained
the precedency of my promiscuous cotemporaries,
I had no alternative but to enter into
competition with myself. That I have to so
wonderful an extent exceeded my own super-excellence,
therefore, cannot be considered
strange; but, as you are evidently gratified
in a manner perfectly unparalleled by the unimaginable
superiority of my poetic genius, I
will show my consideration of your admirable
sagacity by enrapturing you still more completely
by a more transcendental attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the sublime;&rdquo; and the young Chinese began
unfolding another paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you,&rdquo;
said Oriel, rising as if to depart. &ldquo;I have
business of importance that requires my immediate
attendance; and, having waited for Long
Chi so long, I am afraid I cannot protract my
visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to be ravished by the immortal praises
of the adorable Fee Fo Fum?&rdquo; exclaimed the
melancholy poet in the utmost astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot allow myself that pleasure at present,&rdquo;
said the merchant&rsquo;s son, courteously, yet
looking as if he was impatient to be gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written an indestructible epos in fifty
cantos, descriptive of all her beauties, with a
due regard of anatomy. I&rsquo;ll read you the
whole of it, if you will stay,&rdquo; added the lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m infinitely thankful; but my time is
precious,&rdquo; observed Oriel, making rapid strides
to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will enrapture you with a thousand
hexameters declaratory of my incommunicable
affections,&rdquo; shouted the prolific versifier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, Long Chi,&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel Porphyry, as he opened the door,
evidently very desirous of making his escape.
He was on the point of leaving the room, accompanied
by Zabra, when he was stopped in
his progress by the appearance of a stout elderly
Chinese, wearing the appearance of profound
gravity. No sooner had he entered, than
the poet shuffled his papers hastily into his
pouch, jumped off the divan, and approached
the stranger with looks of veneration and awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, here are the barbarians you expected,&rdquo;
said he. The ceremony of introduction
was soon over; the two friends returned
to their seats; and old Long Chi, seating himself
cross-legged on the divan, commenced a
conversation with his visitors, while his son
remained standing beside him in respectful
attention. He was dressed in a fashion somewhat
similar to that of the younger Chinese;
but the materials were not so gay, nor were
they formed with so much neatness; and he
wore boots of black satin instead of slippers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and a short cloak of fine cloth trimmed with
fur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been sacrificing at the temple,
which has detained me longer than I anticipated,&rdquo;
said Long Chi the elder. &ldquo;But religion
is the first concern of life. Nothing
should stand in the way of religion. The
Bonzes are the only teachers of truth; and
the worship of Fo is the only way that leads
to virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither Zabra nor his patron attempted to
dispute this doctrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been reading, father,&rdquo; falteringly
uttered the poet&mdash;&ldquo;I have been reading&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Long Chi,&rdquo; exclaimed
his parent sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I obey,&rdquo; murmured the obedient
youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obedience is the first of virtues, and duty
to parents the first of all obedience,&rdquo; remarked
the old man, with a tone that seemed to his son
more infallible than the sentence. &ldquo;Children,
obey your parents, saith our religion; and if
they are disobedient we give them a touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the bamboo.&rdquo; The poet at this moment looked
remarkably grave. &ldquo;Subjects, obey your
rulers, saith the law; and if we become unruly
<em>we</em> get a touch of the bamboo.&rdquo; And the
father looked as grave as his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, I suppose, what is called being
bamboo-zled,&rdquo; observed Oriel Porphyry with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no laughing matter to us, I can assure
you,&rdquo; added the old man feelingly; &ldquo;but
it is a fine thing for children. Our religion
says, Spare the bamboo, and spoil the child:
and I&rsquo;m attentive to religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it said, Spoil the bamboo, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Long Chi!&rdquo; thundered
out the parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I obey,&rdquo; tremblingly replied the
son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bastinado is the best thing in the world
for children,&rdquo; continued the elder, frowning
upon his offspring. &ldquo;We are obliged to provide
for their bodies, and it is but proper we
should do what we can for their soles. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a schism occurs in the family, I always punish
it in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it becomes a sole-cism,&rdquo; added the
young man, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>The old Chinese snatched up a heavy bamboo
cane with which he had been walking, and
swung it furiously round his head, with the intention
of dealing a severe blow upon the poet&rsquo;s
shoulders, but the lover of the adorable Fee Fo
Fum jumped out of the way with more agility
than submission, and the blow chipped off a
corner of the japanned table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the way you show your obedience,
you undutiful wretch?&rdquo; shouted Long Chi, as
he jumped off the divan, in a rage after the
offender. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your religion? Where&rsquo;s
your duty to parents? Spare the bamboo and
spoil the child! Come and be bastinadoed, you
ungrateful youth!&rdquo; So saying, he waddled after
his son as rapidly as he could, making desperate
attempts to knock him down; but as Long Chi
the younger not only was not so dutiful as to
wait to be bastinadoed, but jumped out of the
way of the blows as fast as they were aimed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
him, Long Chi the elder, much fatigued by
his exertions, at last returned to the divan, after
having afforded infinite diversion to his visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder the roof doesn&rsquo;t fall in and cover
you, you unnatural offspring!&rdquo; exclaimed the
father, shaking the bamboo at his son, who stood
trembling at a respectful distance; then wiping
the perspiration from his shaven crown, he
added, addressing the young friends, and the
poet, by turns, &ldquo;You are shocked, no doubt,
at this instance of youthful depravity&mdash;Oh the
graceless scoundrel! to run away from his affectionate
father, who was going to beat him
black and blue!&mdash;But I am happy to say, that
there are few children in China so indifferent
to the mild virtues of paternal government.&mdash;Come
here, and let me knock your undutiful
head into a thousand pieces, you vagabond!&mdash;It
is a sad thing, I acknowledge, for the father of
a family, who is anxious to bring up a child in
the way it should go, to find it so insensible of
his loving-kindness.&mdash;Oh, if I had you near
enough, I&rsquo;d smash you into a custard, you
graceless varlet!&mdash;but you see a parent&rsquo;s heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
is always overflowing with natural affection for
his own flesh and blood.&mdash;By the great Fo, I
should be delighted to bastinado you within an
inch of your life!&mdash;Religion and morality, in
these atheistical times, are thought nothing of
by some children.&mdash;Haven&rsquo;t I brought you up,
you heathen! on purpose to knock you down?&mdash;But
this isn&rsquo;t the worst of it&mdash;they have become
rank republicans. They have no proper
notion of law, order, or government. When
the father takes to his bamboo, the son takes to
his heels&mdash;abominable rebel!&mdash;and when one
flies in a passion the other flies in his face&mdash;unparalleled
traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entrance of servants, announcing that
dinner was ready, put an end to the altercation;
and Long Chi the elder, with much suavity,
pressed his visitors to remain his guests for the
remainder of the day; which invitation Oriel
Porphyry, imagining that he should be free from
all persecution from the rhyming propensities
of his host&rsquo;s son, and expecting some amusement
from the peculiarities of the two, forgot his engagements,
and agreed to prolong his visit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Long Chi the elder then took one hand of each
of his guests in his own and proceeded with
them into a handsome apartment, furnished in
a style similar to the one they had left. In the
centre was a small low table, having four seats
or cushions at its sides. The father and son sat
opposite each other, cross-legged: and their
visitors sat as comfortably as they could, facing
each other, at the other sides of the table. Before
each was placed three elegant porcelain
saucers, one containing soy, another a small
quantity of vinegar, and the other was empty;
and, beside these, were two little ivory sticks.
The other part of the table was covered with
similar porcelain saucers, filled with various
specimens of Chinese cookery in fish, flesh, and
fowl, cut small; and servants handed round these
with dishes of vegetables, such as cabbages,
cucumbers, rice, and cauliflowers; and pastry
of many different kinds, as they were directed
by the host.</p>

<p>Both Oriel and Zabra watched with considerable
surprise the two Chinese take the
little ivory sticks in the three first fingers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
right hand, and, placing the head forward, and
opening the mouth wide, dip them in the
saucers, catching up pieces of flesh, which they
flavoured with the vinegar, and dexterously flinging
them into their mouths; and repeating the
process so rapidly, that the eye could scarcely
follow their movements. The guests attempted
the same man&oelig;uvres; but, as may easily be
imagined, they were not so successful: for one
piece that went into the mouth, a dozen went
out; and, rapidly as the different saucers were
handed to them, by the desire of the master of
the house, they found that their appetites were
not in any thing like the same degree becoming
satisfied. Pieces of silver paper were frequently
placed near them, with which they as frequently
wiped their mouths and fingers, and not before
such an operation was required; for their awkward
attempts at imitating their entertainers
occasioned them to deposit on their persons a
considerable portion of the gravy or sauces in
which the meat was dressed. Old Long Chi
was indefatigable in endeavouring to make his
visiters taste the contents of every saucer upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the table; in which effort they would gladly have
seconded him, had their ability kept pace with
their inclinations; but, to their exceeding disappointment,
they found that the more they
tried the less they swallowed; and, although
they dipped their sticks and bobbed their heads
after the savoury viands as they dropped from
their treacherous hold, they had the mortification
of finding, when the saucers were cleared away,
that they were left in the enjoyment of quite
as much appetite as they possessed when they
first sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>Several kinds of soups were now brought
on table, in curious boat-shaped vessels of
porcelain; and with these, to the great gratification
of the guests, appeared ivory spoons.
Every one of the soups was tasted; and gladly
would Oriel have made use of his spoon upon
the more substantial cookeries that had been
carried away: but he saw no more of them;
and, the table having been cleared of the soups,
fruits, and preserves, with glasses of a spirit made
from rice were handed round. At this time,
Long Chi the elder bent his head reverentially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and said, in a fervent manner, and with an
audible voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grant, O Fo, that the good things thou
hast so bountifully provided for us do not
interfere with our digestion, or trouble us with
apoplexy!&rdquo; and left the apartment to change
his dress; soon after which the guests, preceded
by the younger Long Chi, returned to
the saloon, where they partook of tea and
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that the old boy has gone,&rdquo; said the
melancholy poet, as soon as he had seated
himself on the divan, &ldquo;I will give you the
felicitous gratification of hearing the perusal of
my great epic in praise of the adorable Fee Fo
Fum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for the world!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry,
with remarkable emphasis; &ldquo;I would
not trouble you on any account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; cried the lover, as he commenced
searching in his pouch; &ldquo;by the
inconceivable tail of Confucius, &rsquo;tis to me the
most superlatively exquisite of extraordinary
gratifications; and, when you come to entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a proper consciousness of the inestimable treasures
of intellectual greatness, which I have
lavished with so profuse a liberality for the
purpose of giving immortality to the unrivalled
attractions of the adorable Fee Fo Fum, you
will acknowledge, with that profound sagacity
which you have already evinced by your commendation
of my incorruptible effusions, that
the particular portions of the diurnal revolution
you have passed in obtaining an adequate
knowledge of its innumerable excellences, has
appeared to you to proceed with such an agreeable
velocity, that you cannot, with any particular
positiveness, assert that you have, during
that period, been in a state which is vulgarly
called existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of it,&rdquo; replied Oriel, with
considerable uneasiness, as he observed his tormentor
unfolding a paper for perusal; &ldquo;but I
can only enjoy such things at certain periods;
and at present I am positive that the merits
of your productions would be entirely lost upon
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the great Fo, impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the poet. &ldquo;In what corner of the world hides
the wretch so lost to every noble feeling&mdash;so
lost to every sense of excellence&mdash;so inhuman,
unnatural, and preposterously ignorant&mdash;as to
listen to the incorruptible wisdom with which I
can enlighten him, and not become transported
into the very heaven of heavens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have already enlightened us to an
extent as far as our limited intellects allow us
to be enlightened by such productions as those
you have read,&rdquo; observed Zabra, with an earnest
attempt to be serious; &ldquo;and it would be only
throwing away the talents you possess on persons
utterly incompetent to appreciate their
merits, if you continue the perusal of your
effusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All imaginary,&rdquo; said the persevering versifier;
&ldquo;and you will forget it in your sense of
the sublime which must be excited by hearing
the perusal of the following passage.&rdquo; Long
Chi the younger had opened his manuscript,
had made a preparatory flourish of his hand,
and had commenced some description, with the
ordinary exclamation, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; when, happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to cast his eye towards the door, he encountered
the frowning visage of his father. His hand
dropped from its elevation: he quickly whipped
his papers into his pouch, and jumped off the
divan, with a celerity particularly acceptable to
Zabra and his companion.</p>

<p>Old Long Chi appeared in a dress much
more splendid than the one he had previously
worn; and, gravely fixing himself in the seat his
son had vacated, he commenced a conversation
upon the business and voyage of his guests.
Old Long Chi was a merchant of considerable
experience and great wealth, with whom Master
Porphyry had long had commercial dealings.
He was remarkable for a profound gravity, a
pair of moustachios the points of which
descended to his chin, and a tail of hair which
was the admiration of all his countrymen.
Although he had passed the early part of his
life in India, and had married an Anglo-Indian,
on his return, like all Chinese, he continued
the customs of his country, and gloried in its
fancied superiority over the rest of the world.
He had always been distinguished as a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
moralist. He seemed desirous of acquiring the
praise of the Bonzes for the regularity of his
attendance at the temples; and sought to be
respected in society for the liberality of his
contributions towards religious objects. Oriel
and he were a considerable time agreeing about
some merchandise that both had to barter;
during which the melancholy poet stood at a
respectful distance, looking at his parent, and
then at the bamboo, with more dread than
affection; while Zabra amused himself by taking
notice of the scene before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not seen much of our incomparable
country, I suppose?&rdquo; inquired the old
man as he sipped a strong infusion of the tea
leaf from a beautiful porcelain cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only landed this morning,&rdquo; replied
his guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! then you have much to see,&rdquo; added
the other. &ldquo;It is the most ancient government
under the sun; and such a government! such
laws, such institutions, and such a religion!
The Emperor is quite a father to his subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;With the bamboo, father?&rdquo; asked his son
tremblingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold you tongue, Long Chi!&rdquo; bawled out
the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I obey!&rdquo; murmured the youth
submissively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the laws mild in their operation?&rdquo;
inquired Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so,&rdquo; replied Long Chi the
elder. &ldquo;When punishment is inflicted, it is
done on the most humane principles: you
may get bastinadoed till you faint with pain;
and then you will get bastinadoed till you
recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very paternal!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
Long Chi emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, Long Chi!&rdquo; shouted the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I obey!&rdquo; said his obedient son.</p>

<p>Both Zabra and his patron seemed much
amused by this description of the mildness of
the Chinese laws; but, fearing, if he pressed the
subject much farther, the bamboo might come
into operation in the domestic sovereignty with
a similar character, Oriel Porphyry said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was much surprised with the great variety
of dishes that appeared at dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our preparations for the table are endless,&rdquo;
responded his host. &ldquo;In our cookery books we
have fifty different ways of dressing dogs&rsquo; ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could find a way of dressing dogs&rsquo; ears in
any book,&rdquo; muttered the melancholy poet at a
distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give yours a dressing, you puppy! if
you don&rsquo;t hold your tongue,&rdquo; bawled his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dogs&rsquo; ears!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra in surprise:
&ldquo;we had none to-day, had we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had six different varieties, of each of
which you partook,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, with a countenance
expressing any thing but pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was not the only delicacy brought
on table,&rdquo; continued the old man. &ldquo;You
seemed particularly to enjoy a fricassee of the
rats of Loo Choo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats! we haven&rsquo;t been eating rats, surely?&rdquo;
demanded Zabra, as if horrorstruck at the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you swallowed nearly the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the soup made from the large slugs of Japan!&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; exclaimed both his visiters in a
breath, looking in the highest degree disgusted
at the idea of such fare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous,&rdquo; said the melancholy poet,
gravely, &ldquo;to load either the stomach or your
arms with slugs; especially&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was not
allowed time to finish the sentence; for, seeing
his father snatch up the dreaded bamboo, and
spring off the divan towards him, with a look
threatening utter extermination, he dived under
a table, leaped over an ottoman, dodged round
several vases, and then rapidly made his exit
out at the door, closely pursued by his parent;
and their visiters, fancying that they had had
quite enough of Chinese hospitality, hastened
their departure.</p>

<p>They were proceeding through the narrow
streets of Canton, bounded by the gloomy walls
that shut out the houses from public view, experiencing
some very disagreeable sensations,
when they heard a violent altercation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
thought they distinguished voices familiar to
them. They listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! oh! This is not arguing logically.
Oh! oh! This is demonstration without
reason. Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; was heard amid a
shower of blows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! you&rsquo;re breaking my back&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see! Ah! murder! help!&rdquo; was shouted
with similar accompaniments; and a door in the
wall opening, out ran Fortyfolios and Tourniquet,
making a desperate outcry, and vainly
striving to save themselves from the thick sticks
of half a dozen infuriated Chinese, who were
belabouring them without mercy. Oriel, as soon
as he saw the state of the case, rushed in
amongst the attacking party; quickly deprived
one of his weapon, and laid about him with
such dexterity and vigour, that three out of the
six were left senseless on the ground, and the
rest had vanished before the philosophers discovered
to whom they were indebted for their
rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am astonished that I should have found
you in such a situation,&rdquo; remarked the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
merchant to the professor and his companion,
who, with most rueful visages, were busily engaged
in rubbing their legs, shoulders, arms,
and backs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I will explain it to you as logically
as I can,&rdquo; said Fortyfolios, moving his features
and body into an abundance of contortions.
&ldquo;Oh, this pain! it certainly is a physical evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I deny!&rdquo; eagerly exclaimed the other,
writhing from the effects of his beating. &ldquo;Pain
is a perception of the mind, and cannot exist
independently of mental perceptions&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; replied the professor, limping
along as if every bone in his body was broken.
&ldquo;I maintain that it is a sensation purely corporeal,
as there never yet was any pain where
there was no body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know nothing about it,&rdquo; sharply rejoined
the doctor, cautiously feeling with his
hands to discover his fractures. &ldquo;There is
mental anguish, in which the physical has no
connection&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, what has this argument to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
do with the information I required?&rdquo; asked the
young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to enter into the subject in a
proper manner, when Doctor Tourniquet interrupted
me,&rdquo; observed Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deny that!&rdquo; eagerly exclaimed the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Tourniquet, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself!&rdquo; said the professor, assuming
all his dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deny that!&rdquo; repeated the pertinacious
disputant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, you are more than usually disputative,&rdquo;
remarked Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deny that!&rdquo; continued he: and it now
became evident to Oriel Porphyry and his
young friend, that both the professor and the
doctor were exhilarated into a state nearly approaching
intoxication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Demonstration! demonstration! Give me
accurate demonstration: I&rsquo;ll not be convinced
without it&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; said the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Argument is thrown away upon you: you
are unreasonable, illogical, and inconvincible,&rdquo;
muttered the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Prove it! prove it! Give me the proof
positive&mdash;let me behold the proof circumstantial,&rdquo;
exclaimed his antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Tourniquet, I beg you&rsquo;ll be silent,&rdquo;
said the young merchant, in a tone that admitted
of no dispute; and the doctor seemed
only anxious to discover the extent of the
hurts he had received. &ldquo;And now, Professor
Fortyfolios,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you can proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To come to a proper understanding of the
case, you must be made aware that we left the
Albatross on purpose to see whatever was
worthy of observation in the city,&rdquo; observed
the professor; &ldquo;and, as I possessed a letter of
introduction to a Columbian resident, there we
first proceeded. We were heartily welcomed,
and treated with a national hospitality; and
were shown several remarkable things, of which
the world will hear at a fitting opportunity. In
returning from a place we had visited together,
our friend suddenly left us to talk to some acquaintance
he saw at the end of the street; and
we thought we saw him go into a house, where
we knocked. We were admitted; and I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
explaining to the fellows, by whom we were
immediately surrounded, that I desired to see
my friend; but, without the slightest attempt
at argument, the unreasonable brutes commenced
beating us with heavy cudgels, till
they were dispersed by your appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see if I have killed these poor
wretches,&rdquo; said Oriel, turning back to the place
where he had left the three prostrate Chinese;
but, to his great astonishment, and to the
amazement of his companions, not a trace of
either of them was to be seen. The dead men
had taken advantage of their enemy being at a
distance to scamper off from the field of battle
as fast as their legs could carry them; and
when the conqueror came to examine the
destruction he had committed, he had the
mortification of discovering that his triumph
might take same note of &ldquo;the missing,&rdquo; but the
number of killed and wounded was not so easily
ascertained.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VIII" id="CHAP_VIII">CHAP. VIII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE MONSOON.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">After</span> paying short visits to some of the principal
ports in the flourishing kingdoms of
Borneo and Sumatra, the Albatross was gallantly
pursuing her voyage through the Strait
of Malacca. There had been no wind for several
days, and the sky had continued without a cloud.
There was an oppressive sultriness in the atmosphere;
and so great appeared the heat of the
sun&rsquo;s rays, that the pitch oozed out of the seams
of the vessel, and the timber became scorched
and blistered. This continued, with very little
variation, till the ship, approaching the coast of
India, entered the Bay of Bengal. A little
speck was first observed upon the horizon,
which gradually enlarged; and soon afterwards
several other dark vapours appearing on the
heavens, rapidly increased in size, till vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
masses of clouds came from the north-east,
thickening, and darkening, and swallowing up
the whole of the bright sky which had but a
short time since been visible. The sea, from a
state of calm, suddenly became stirred in all its
depths: its billows rose into hills, the hills into
mountains; and the vast waves, as they acquired
additional magnitude, lashed each other
with such a violence, that their tops were crested
with foam. Almost at the same moment came
on powerful gusts of wind, that kept continually
increasing in force, till each drove the mountainous
waves before it, as if they were grains
of dust, and swept the Albatross over them
with as much ease as if it were but a feather.
Her spars bent&mdash;her timbers creaked; and
occasionally some part of the rigging would be
stripped off like dead leaves from a tree.</p>

<p>Floods of rain poured down, as if there was
a sea in the sky that was being emptied into
the waters of the earth; and the lightning,
flashing in streaks of lurid fire, exhibited the
black tempest gathering in the clouds in all its
terrors. Then came the thunder, booming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
deafening peals, that seemed to shake the world
to its centre. The desperate wind rushed on
with all its might&mdash;then came the deluge&mdash;then
flashed the electric light&mdash;and then the
thunder burst again with renewed fury. This
succession of forces was exerted upon the ship,
without intermission, the whole of the night, as
she scudded rapidly along under close-reefed
foresail and maintop-sail; but, although it was
evident to the oldest sailors in the vessel, from
the manner in which she behaved during the
tempest, that a more admirable boat had never
been built, she suffered very severely in many
places. Several of the ports were stove in,
the gangways torn away, the quarter galleries
crushed; ropes were snapped like threads, and
a few of the spars were splintered into fragments.
The water rushed in through the
gaping ports, till the lee side of the main deck
was a complete pool, several feet in depth; and
the monstrous waves swept over the ship in
such immense masses, that many of the crew
every moment expected that she would be overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards morning, the fury of the elements in
some degree abated; but the broken spars, and
the torn rigging, had scarcely been repaired,
before the storm recommenced with renewed
vigour. Nothing seemed capable of withstanding
its destructive violence. The wind howled,
and the thunder boomed, and the lightning
flashed, and the big waves came rushing on with
more fury than ever. Every timber creaked,
and the ship was leaking at every seam. The
exertions of the old captain had not ceased
since the commencement of the tempest. In
the loudest roar of the storm, his voice might be
heard shouting his orders through a speaking-trumpet.
He was everywhere where he thought
his presence was necessary; and, forgetting his
superiority in the necessities of the moment, he
bore a hand in the most laborious and dangerous
duties. He was ably seconded by his officers;
and, although the crew had been harassed by
constant exertion, they cheerfully continued
their efforts to work the vessel, and save her
from the violence with which she was assailed.
To add to their disquietude, they discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
that she had been forced a considerable way
from her course, and that there was an alarming
depth of water in the hold: the fore-mast
bent like a mere twig; and every instant the
fore-topmast threatened to go by the board.</p>

<p>The engine was immediately set to work to
reduce the leak; and, a sufficient power having
been applied, the water began to diminish. The
helm was now directed towards Bengal. The men
laboured indefatigably to repair the injuries the
ship had sustained; and hopes were entertained
that, if the masts remained secure, the Albatross
might ride out the monsoon, and reach
her destination in safety. Towards the afternoon,
there was a lull, and the men got both
refreshment and repose. Oriel Porphyry had
not left the deck during the whole of the time
the danger was most imminent; and Zabra, as
usual, had continued by his side. Both seemed
to take a sort of fearful interest in watching
the progress of the tempest; and, although the
water dashed over them in torrents, and they
were frequently obliged to hold on with all
their strength, to prevent being swept away by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the wind, they remained in nearly the same
position, observing the vivid flashes of light
that played amid the rigging, and looking into
the black depths of the foaming ocean, as they
descended into the trough of some mighty
wave. Neither spoke: at least, rarely was a
word uttered; and, if the friends had attempted
to converse, the uproar that raged around them
would have prevented any other sound from
being heard. Several times Captain Hearty
approached, and earnestly advised them to go
below, as they exposed themselves to much
unnecessary danger; but Zabra remained, with
his head resting upon the shoulder of his patron,
and his hand clasped in Oriel&rsquo;s, as if he knew
of no protection where he was not; and the
merchant&rsquo;s son, as if pleased with the affection
of his youthful friend, would not be persuaded
to leave the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any thing ail you, Zabra?&rdquo; at last
asked Master Porphyry, during an intermission
of the storm, noticing that his companion had
made two or three short hysteric sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am well, I am quite well, Oriel,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
murmured the youth, as he raised his head, and
looked in the face of his associate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, your eyes are filled with tears,
Zabra! How is this?&rdquo; exclaimed the other
affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not. A feeling has come over me,
which I could not control,&rdquo; replied he in a
whisper, as his delicate frame trembled with
emotion. &ldquo;I was thinking&mdash;I was thinking
that, if the ship was swallowed up in these
huge waves, that&mdash;that I should like&mdash;that I
should like to die&mdash;that I should like to die
with you thus;&rdquo; and, with many sobs, he flung
his arms round the neck of his patron, and let
his head droop upon his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you shall, Zabra, if such fate be
ours,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, much moved by
the devotion of his young friend. &ldquo;But I see
no reason to despair yet. The gallant Albatross
bears it bravely; and, unless we lose the masts,
or ship one of these overwhelming seas, we
shall ride into port by to-morrow, or the next
day at latest. But this is childish of you,
Zabra, to give way to such feelings. You behaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
not in this way when we were fighting
side by side amid the pirates. Come, come! be
more like yourself; and when the storm is over,
which I hope will soon be, you shall laugh at
these apprehensions; and you shall sing me one
of your stirring songs, all about the glory and
the freedom to be found upon the mighty
waters of the deep; and I shall be enraptured,
and you will rejoice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra raised his head, shook back the clustering
curls that shadowed his face, and looked
earnestly upon his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do as you wish me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
have been wrong in disturbing your contemplations
with my foolish fears: but, however proud
the heart may be,&mdash;however great, and brave,
and noble be all its tendencies,&mdash;there comes a
time when all superiority and all valour are lost
in a sense of overpowering humility and apprehension.
But, hark! The elements are again
let loose upon us. Hear how the wind howls,
like a lion roaring for his prey! And look at
this mountain of water sweeping up to ingulf
us within its dark devouring jaws. Cling to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mast, Oriel! cling to the mast! or you will be
swept into the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry held one arm tightly round
the waist of Zabra: with the other he grasped
the mainmast, as the towering billow, forced
onward by a violent gust of wind, broke on the
deck, carrying away two of the sailors, who
were inattentive to its advance, and pouring
through every opening into the lower parts of
the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man overboard!&rdquo; was the immediate
cry: but the vessel was proceeding at so rapid
a rate, that no effort could be made to save
them. When the fury of the tempest had
abated, the two friends descended to the cabin;
where Oriel, observing that Zabra seemed ill
and faint, wanted him to take such refreshment
as his exhausted frame needed, and tried to
strengthen the effect of his command by setting
before him a good example. A long fast, and
the excitement of danger, continued for such
a period of time, required nourishment; and the
young merchant seemed desirous of showing
his companion that his fatigues had not spoiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
his appetite; but though he pressed him frequently
to partake liberally of the different
things he had ordered for him, he could not
induce him to follow his directions to any thing
like the extent he desired. In fact, Zabra appeared
to have suffered too much from the state
of feeling in which he had existed during the
recent tempest to be able to realise the kind
wishes of his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Zabra you are not well,&rdquo; observed
Oriel Porphyry, finding his endeavours and
example so little attended to. &ldquo;You look perfectly
exhausted. Go to your hammock and
endeavour to sleep off your fatigues. If I do
not see that you take proper care of yourself,
I shall deserve censure from Eureka. So if
you do not wish to get me into trouble, you
will do as I desire you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will not blame you,&rdquo; murmured his
youthful associate, as he proceeded to his little
cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary creature he is!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as soon as Zabra had left him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and he was reflecting upon the cause of that
mystery in which the character of his youthful
friend seemed enveloped, when he was disturbed
by the entrance of the two philosophers.
Fortyfolios looked somewhat paler than usual,
nor did Tourniquet appear quite at his ease.
They had also suffered from the effects of the
storm, though neither of them had appeared
on deck while it lasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is extraordinary to me, Dr. Tourniquet,&rdquo;
said the professor gravely, as he entered the
cabin&mdash;&ldquo;It is extraordinary to me that you
will argue from wrong premises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as extraordinary to me that you will
argue to wrong conclusions, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied
the surgeon good humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter in dispute now, gentlemen?&rdquo;
inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We differ in our ideas concerning the true
nature of happiness,&rdquo; responded Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;Now, I maintain that happiness consists in
virtue; for there can be no true happiness without
the existence of virtuous inclinations; and
virtue is but another name for purity&mdash;a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of being perfectly free from the pollution of
vice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I maintain a very different sort of
thing altogether, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied the
doctor. &ldquo;But first of all let us examine the
idea that happiness consists in virtue&mdash;by
which I suppose is meant that virtue produces
happiness. There are a thousand instances of
virtuous people being as miserable as a bear
with his fur shaved off. One from disappointed
love&mdash;another from the death of a friend or
relative, and a third from constitutional irritability.
One finds misery in the past&mdash;another
meets with it in the present&mdash;a third looks for
it in the future; and although all these are
virtuous in the common acceptation of the word,
they are far from being happy, don&rsquo;t you see.
But there is a stronger case against the argument
that virtue produces happiness in the
instance of&mdash;&mdash;Suppose a noble spirited youth,
or an amiable and excellent girl, who may be, in
thought or action, the beau ideals of virtue, yet
if they are disgraced in their own eyes by their
near relationship to individuals notorious for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
some degrading vice, their very notions of virtue
create in them a continual misery. They have
done no evil, yet they are ashamed of themselves&mdash;they
have a most decided inclination
for sincerity; and yet, knowing that if the
world knew of their connection with vice, they
would be considered to be vicious as a natural
consequence (for such is the unjust conduct of
the world), they are obliged to practise deception;
and the practice of deception soon becomes
habitual&mdash;they deceive all around them. Their
principles are thus continually warring with
their actions; and the dread of their deceit
being discovered, and the disgrace which attaches
to them becoming known, creates a state of
misery not easily to be exceeded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot imagine such a state of
things,&rdquo; remarked Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;No child
can be made answerable for the criminality of
its relatives; and a well educated mind will care
little for an opinion by which it is sought to
be degraded, if that opinion is unjust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; observed the professor approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We must take society as we find it, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; added the doctor, &ldquo;with all its prejudices
and all its injustice. If the circle in
which moves a youth of either sex, whose conduct
is irreproachable and whose motives are
admirable, discover that the father of their
young associate was hanged for murder, or
that the mother was noted for profligacy, they
will shrink from him as if he was as vile as his
origin; but to the young female this sort of
connection bears with a most cruel severity.
There are many children born out of wedlock,
of mothers of infamous characters, which the
father, who may be of a somewhat higher rank
of life, with a laudable anxiety for the welfare
of his offspring, takes from the mother and
educates. Imagine a child thus originated,
carefully instructed in virtuous principles till
she approaches the period of womanhood, when,
with the knowledge of her mother&rsquo;s infamy, she
ventures into a society in which her beauty
and intelligence would render her one of its
best ornaments, she is acutely sensitive of her
own disgraceful position in the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
world, and enters into companionship with individuals
of her own sex whom she is well
aware would consider themselves contaminated
by her presence if they knew her secret; or
becomes beloved by a youth of the other sex,
who, thinking her what she appears to be,
honours her above all human beings, with a
continual dread that the truth will be disclosed,
and that she will be pointed at, avoided, insulted,
and abandoned by those now so eager
to seek her society. There is no state of
misery so deplorable as this. In time, the
constant anxiety and fear in which she exists
will affect her health, and she gradually wastes
away with the bitter consciousness that she is
the victim of a prejudice: although perfectly
innocent, is punished as if she was the vilest
of criminals; and, although formed to diffuse
happiness around her, is obliged, from day to
day, to endure the crushing agonies of an unceasing
misery. And this is an example of
virtue without happiness, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But possibly the dread of insult, or a sense
of shame,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;prevents her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
from entering the society in which she ought
to find an honourable place. She is confined
to a narrow circle, out of which she dare not
step, and is obliged to associate with the
worthless of her own sex and the profligate of
the other. Her companions are the vulgar and
the vile. They having no proper conception of
the value of either truth or virtue, and she
looking on the world that has abandoned her
as unjust, and smarting under the wrong it
inflicts, begins to think them as much ill
treated as herself, and believes that a false
interpretation has been given to their conduct.
Gradually she parts with her conviction of
what is honourable. One by one she acquires
the mean and contemptible vices of her associates.
She sees them dissimulate, and practises
deception. Falsehood becomes habitual.
She loses all self-respect. She becomes criminal,
degraded, and depraved. In fact, by an
atrocious verdict, she is at first considered one
of the very Pariahs of society, don&rsquo;t you see,
and is at last forced to be the vile thing the
world had thought her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The prejudice which so punishes is a disgrace
to any civilised community,&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel with warmth, &ldquo;and the laws which press
so cruelly upon natural children are both impolitic
and inhuman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are undoubtedly severe,&rdquo; observed
Fortyfolios; &ldquo;but their severity is caused by
the detestation of society for vice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I deny,&rdquo; eagerly replied Tourniquet.
&ldquo;Change the condition of the child. Suppose
it to be the offspring of a prince; and, although
the mother be a sink of iniquity, the girl will
be eagerly sought after by honourables and
right honourables, most nobles, and others that
entertain the highest notions about virtue. So
much for the community&rsquo;s detestation of vice,
don&rsquo;t you see. Now for my conception of
the true nature of happiness. I consider happiness,
in the first place, to be the result of a
peculiar temperament. There must be a disposition
to be happy in the individual before
any happiness can be created. In some persons
this disposition is so strong, that the most
afflicting things will scarcely, if at all, affect it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in others, the disposition is so weak that it is
continually overpowered by external circumstances;
and in others, the disposition is not to
be traced, for it does not exist. That virtue
is necessary to a state of happiness there is no
doubt; but what is called virtue by different
communities appears in so many various shapes,
that it requires a more catholic sense attached
to it than it possesses to make it universally
understood. I consider virtue to be a moderate
indulgence in our inclinations when they
do no injury to the individual, to the object,
and to any other person, with a perfect and exclusive
sympathy of an individual of one sex for
an individual of the other. Modesty is called
a virtue, chastity is called a virtue, and sobriety
is called a virtue; but they are only distinct
features of the virtue I have described.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is clearly enough defined; and I
should think could not be disputed,&rdquo; remarked
Oriel.</p>

<p>The professor said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this virtue does not create happiness
any more than does the virtue of my learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
friend,&rdquo; continued the doctor; &ldquo;but in by
far the majority of instances it is necessary to
its existence. The happiness that arises from
alleviating suffering has often been found in an
individual possessing no pretensions to virtue.
But happiness itself is pleasure. There is the
pleasure of creating enjoyment in an object,
and there is the pleasure which succeeds it in
the individual. There never was happiness
without pleasure; there ought not to be pleasure
without happiness. There is no pleasure
like that of doing good; consequently, there is
no happiness like that of making others happy:
and wherever there is a disposition to be happy,
it will exhibit itself in a desire to create happiness
in others; and wherever there is no disposition
to be happy, the individual will be just
as careless of the happiness of those around
him as he is regardless of his own. That&rsquo;s my
idea of happiness, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it appears to me a very rational one,&rdquo;
observed the young merchant. &ldquo;But how does
the disposition to happiness arise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some very curious phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
connected with the origin and growth of these
dispositions,&rdquo; replied the surgeon. &ldquo;In the
first place, all dispositions are formed in the
individual by the pressure of external circumstances,
no matter how or from whence directed:
evil dispositions and good, and they arise at
different times and sometimes in succession.
When created, they set with a certain impetus
in a certain direction; and as in these the extremes
meet, if another impetus is given, they
will proceed from bad to good to the same distance
they advanced from good to bad. This is
the cause of individuals having been notorious
for vice becoming eminent for virtue. Water
flowing from the top of a mountain is capable
by its own power of finding its level on a
mountain of a similar elevation; and the impetus
of vice being carried down a certain way ascends
by the impetus of good a like height. This
accounts for the old proverb, &lsquo;The greater the
sinner the greater the saint;&rsquo; that is to say, the
force in one produces a like force in the other.
Again, the disposition to love has frequently
been followed by the disposition to hate, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
nearly as possible to the same extent; and the
disposition to happiness may as frequently be
succeeded by the disposition to misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But supposing the impetus to be carried
down, it will want the application of no other
power to carry it up; and if carried up, will
unassisted carry itself down,&rdquo; remarked the
professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied the doctor: &ldquo;Evil is of a
heavy nature; and when it descends, clings to
the soil at the bottom, unless it receive another
impetus: and good is of a light nature, that
naturally rises, and when it has attained its
highest elevation would there remain, were it
not sent down with a similar force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea is ingenious, certainly,&rdquo; said the
young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is all the merit it possesses,&rdquo; observed
Fortyfolios, whose more orthodox notions
could not tolerate such an hypothesis. &ldquo;Were
such a theory generally adopted, its mischief
would be incalculable. It would loosen our sense
of the moral obligations, and utterly destroy
all the established ideas of right and wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the moral obligations, don&rsquo;t you
see,&rdquo; replied Tourniquet, &ldquo;I am perfectly
convinced that it would place them on a much
more secure footing than they now possess; and
if established notions on the subject are erroneous,
which I can prove them to be, the sooner
they are knocked on the head the better. I
have already shown to you, in the instance of
the natural child, that the idea of virtue in the
community is very vague, unsettled, and unphilosophical,
and creates more mischief than it
does good; and if we take the ideas of the same
principle existing at different times and in
different communities, we shall find even this
confusion worse confounded. Things the most
opposite to the true character of virtue have
been considered worthy of general adoption as
virtues. Thieving has existed as a virtue;
drunkenness has existed as a virtue; profligacy
has existed as a virtue; murder has existed as a
virtue; and many others of the most abominable
vices have, at various intervals, with various
people, been practised, avowed, and defended,
as if they were the most admirable of virtues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
It is not many centuries since the natives, on
the coast of Guinea, and the inhabitants of other
countries, were taught to steal, and the cleverest
thief was an object of as much admiration among
them as the most virtuous member of the community;
but there is no necessity to go to a
state of barbarism for an illustration of the
honour with which dishonesty has been regarded;
for in all speculations, in all trading dealings, in
all gambling transactions, and in all appropriations
of property acquired by one party from
another by a certain cunning or skill, of which
the other is not possessed, there is nothing else
but stealing; and yet a person acquiring property
by such means is generally thought to be
respectable, and respectability is considered a
virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, if your argument be true, that
there is but little real honesty in the world,&rdquo;
remarked Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as I have stated,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
&ldquo;I have read of states in which the man who
could swallow some half a dozen bottles of wine,
and make his friends follow his example&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
other words, a man who practised habitual intoxication&mdash;had
the reputation of being &lsquo;a
good fellow,&rsquo; when amongst the same people
goodness was considered virtue; but even at
the present day, in some parts of the world,
intemperance is regarded as a thing to be applauded
rather than censured, although it is
not only a vice, but being the most direct
channel to all other vices ought to be held in
detestation as the most vicious of evil inclinations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry thought of the scene he had
witnessed at Canton; but he smiled, and said
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to the next of these vices
which are considered as virtues,&rdquo; continued the
doctor, &ldquo;there are few so destructive to happiness.
What is vulgarly called virtue in the
government or indulgence of the affections, in
a majority of instances, should go by an opposite
name. It is upon record, that a certain
king of Ashantee was possessed of 3333 wives:
other monarchs have been equally affectionate
towards their female subjects; and it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
rare, indeed, to find these potentates, even with
the wise king Solomon at their head, possessing
any pretensions to this identical virtue; and yet
they have been honoured more than the most
virtuous character in their dominions. But I
maintain that all marriages against the inclination
of one or both parties, such as those formed
for convenience, from state policy, or by the
authority of parents and guardians, is a state of
absolute vice; and yet the individuals so existing
are regarded as if living in a state of perfect
virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly they live in a state of perfect
virtue as long as they have no vicious inclinations,&rdquo;
said the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it frequently happens that one of these
parties has entertained an inclination for another
before marriage,&rdquo; replied Tourniquet. &ldquo;An
inclination perfectly virtuous, but circumstances
over which either have no control, force them
into a marriage, and then in the opinion of the
world that inclination (which is rarely destroyed)
is considered vicious, though perfectly virtuous
in itself, and the state in which the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
exists, against his or her inclination, is considered
virtuous, though perfectly vicious in itself, because
it tends either to destroy the virtuous
inclination, or if that inclination is indulged
under those circumstances, it creates a state of
things which is just as far removed from virtue.
The same species of vice is created by an inclination
after marriage&mdash;which is likely to
occur when the marriage has taken place without
an inclination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one time the punishment used to be
very severe for endeavouring to effect a marriage
or a similar state of things against the
inclination of one of the parties,&rdquo; remarked
the young merchant. &ldquo;And I imagine that if
the mis-marriages to which you have alluded
were punished after the same fashion, both the
public morals and the public happiness would
be much increased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; responded
the doctor. &ldquo;And now for an examination of
the manner in which murder has been regarded.
About a thousand years since there was a religious
community in India who practised murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
as a virtue. They were called Thugs, and
after long watching for an opportunity, with
abundance of prayers and other holy ceremonies,
they fell upon their victims and strangled them
with a cord. Previous to this, there arose a military
and religious order in Persia, called Assassins,
who stabbed or poisoned in secrecy and
without shame; and by both these communities
murder was practised as the highest kind of
virtue. But they were not the only people
who entertained similar notions. The heathens
murdered the Christians, and the Christians
slaughtered the heathens. The Catholics destroyed
heretics, and heretics waged a religious
war upon one another. The Mahometans
killed Jews or Christians, or any other sect not
professing their form of faith; and the Jews,
Christians, and others, retaliated to the best of
their ability; and under the name of religion
nearly all religious sects have murdered by wholesale,
and, practising this inhuman vice, each
party has conceived that they were exhibiting
the highest kind of virtue. But at the present
day, murder in a variety of shapes exists, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
is regarded as a virtue of a very high order.
Even in an offender, the destruction of human
life is murder, unless, which is a very extreme
case, it be impossible for the security of society,
to allow the offender to exist; yet the sanguinary
executions that disgrace the penal
codes of many communities, boasting a superior
degree of civilisation, is called justice,
which is but another name for virtue. Killing
a man in a duel is murder. All warfare is murder;
yet he who distinguishes himself most in
the destruction of those to whom he is opposed
is honoured as being peculiarly brave&mdash;and
bravery is considered a virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Occasions arise when warfare is absolutely
necessary,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry; &ldquo;and I cannot
help the conviction, that the man who signalises
himself in the defence of his country,
and in the destruction of his enemies, is entitled
to rank with the most virtuous characters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; observed Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to wars being necessary, don&rsquo;t
you see, in the present state of the world they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
may be,&rdquo; replied the surgeon. &ldquo;But in an improved
order of things they would not be required,
for then the force of opinion would be
much more effective than the force of arms;
and as to the superior character of valour, although
few can admire heroic actions more
than myself, I know that the courage by which
they are created is an impulse which may exist
to the same extent in the savage and in the
brute. This is not necessary to virtue, for in
some organisations the want of physical energy
renders the existence and the exhibition of
martial courage impossible; and it is not produced
by virtue, for it is often found existing in
persons of the most vicious inclinations. Now
I think I have said enough to show the want of
clearness in the ideas of virtue that have existed
and do exist in the world, and the danger
which must arise from attempting to build any
happiness upon so insecure a foundation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I differ with you <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed the
professor, with more than his usual seriousness.
&ldquo;And glad I am that such is the case; for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
heathenish theories are destructive of every
religious principle that the human mind possesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; muttered the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an argument, the tendency of which
goes directly to level all the existing distinctions
between right and wrong, and to weaken
the influence of those sacred truths which have
been professed by mankind for so many generations,&rdquo;
continued Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may profess what opinions you please,&rdquo;
he added; &ldquo;but the opinions on which multitudes
of people rest their expectations of future
happiness ought not to be disturbed by the
contemplation of such vain and idle speculations
as those in which you indulge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Dr. Tourniquet, it is rank
atheism,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, rather
warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Professor Fortyfolios, you&rsquo;re a
goose,&rdquo; replied his antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As usual, gentlemen, your argument ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in a dispute,&rdquo; observed Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;But
you must excuse me for the present. I am
really tired out, and have been yawning in a
manner that would have silenced any disputants
less eager than yourselves. I shall go to my
berth, which example I should advise you to
follow; and let us hope that the terrible monsoon
will allow us some repose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The philosophers took the advice that was
offered; and in less than half an hour all three
were fast asleep in their hammocks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IX" id="CHAP_IX">CHAP. IX.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">GAME LAWS IN INDIA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Pooh</span>, pooh! Come and hunt. Come and
hunt. There is no use in looking after a parcel
of buildings, and running to see sights:
now you are in this part of the country you
ought to enjoy the pleasures it affords. Come
and hunt, man. Come and hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said by a fine, stout, middle-aged
man, dressed in a light jean jacket and full
lower garments of a similar fabric, with a very
broad brimmed hat of fine straw, which he was
then putting on. Although his complexion
was sallow, his features were lively and intelligent;
and there was a bluff, free, careless manner
with him that seemed particularly agreeable
to his companions. They were in a handsome
chamber with an open veranda, through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the slight breeze that was stirring, entered; and
the furniture, though rather faded, still possessed
an air of elegance. Wines, fruits, and
sweetmeats were on a large table in the centre,
near which Oriel Porphyry and the speaker
stood. Zabra was leaning over the back of a
cane-bottomed seat, watching the motions of a
lizard crawling up part of the framework of the
veranda. Fortyfolios was busily engaged endeavouring
to beat off several mosquitoes that
seemed to have taken a fancy to his bald head;
and Dr. Tourniquet was examining the tusk of
an elephant that lay, with several skins, in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but, Sir Curry Rajah,&rdquo; replied the
young merchant, &ldquo;when you kindly invited us
to your country house, I told you our stay
could be but brief. The period I intended to
pass with you has elapsed; and though delighted
with your hospitality, I must really be
thinking of my departure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed his host.
&ldquo;You wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be thinking of any thing of the
kind. There is no business waiting for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
My people in the city will take care that every
thing you required shall be shipped safely without
loss of time; and, therefore, there can be
no occasion for your troubling your young
brains about profit and loss for a day or two
at least. Come and hunt, I tell you. Come
and hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any good hunting in this part of
the world, then?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunting! The best hunting in the universe,&rdquo;
replied Sir Curry Rajah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the finest preserves in all India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what game have you?&rdquo; asked his
visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Game?&mdash;Game of all kinds, and plenty
of it; especially tigers,&rdquo; responded the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tigers!&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant
in so loud a voice that his companions started
with surprise. &ldquo;Why, what could induce you
to preserve such animals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sport, to be sure, man,&rdquo; replied Sir
Curry; &ldquo;and we are obliged to be very strict
in the application of our game laws; for the
rascally poachers will often destroy the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think the game more likely to
destroy the poachers,&rdquo; observed his guest with
a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their look out,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I
only know it&rsquo;s a most difficult thing to preserve
tigers. My tenants shoot them if they happen
to attack their flocks; and the peasants combine
to kill them, for the purpose of procuring
their skins. But our game laws punish the
scoundrels severely if they are caught in the
fact&mdash;imprisonment and hard labour for every
offence, and very just these laws are. Why,
gentlemen would have no sport if they were to
allow their game to be cut up by every fellow
who has a desire for sport, or thinks his life or
the lives of his cattle of more value than a tiger.
I have been at great expense with my preserves;
for the animal has long been exceedingly
scarce: and I have improved the breed a
great deal by importing some new varieties.
The cross which has ensued has altered the
game wonderfully. They are infinitely more
savage, far more daring, and in speed and cunning
are not to be excelled. In fact, my tigers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
have a reputation all over the country; and
the ablest hunters are very glad to get a day&rsquo;s
sport with me, as they know they will meet
with the best tigers that are to be found any
where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you hunt them?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On elephants principally,&rdquo; replied Sir
Curry. &ldquo;The hunter sits upon an elephant,
with an air gun, fixed upon a swivel, before
him. These animals are well trained. I&rsquo;ve
got some of the finest elephants in the world,
thorough-bred&mdash;and they go into the preserve,
and rouse the tiger from his cover. If he goes
off, the elephant follows; if he shows fight,
the hunter fires: and sometimes the game is
not killed till fine sport has been enjoyed&mdash;a
man or two killed, and other exciting pleasures
enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did these skins belong to animals of
your killing?&rdquo; inquired Tourniquet, who had
been an attentive listener to the conversation,
as he turned over two or three large tiger skins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I killed them, and fine sport they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
gave,&rdquo; said his host. &ldquo;That one you have in
your hand belonged to a noble fellow. The
day in which he was killed was a memorable
one. My late neighbour, Lord Muligatawny,
was very proud of his preserves, and used to
boast he had the best tigers in India. So to
take the conceit out of his lordship, I invited
him to a hunt on my grounds. Well, he came
on his elephant, for he enjoyed the sport as
much as any man, and we proceeded together
with our attendants to a jungle in which I knew
the greatest quantity of game was to be found.
He and I kept close together, he boasting all
the time of the superiority of his preserves, till
as we entered this particular place, I thought
it would be most advisable to be at a short distance
from him, so we separated, but without
my losing sight of him. Now Lord Muligatawny
used a peculiar kind of snuff-box, and
was a fierce looking sort of man; and he used
to say that no tiger could ever look him in the
face. He said the brute always bolted when
he tried the experiment. Well, we saw lots of
game, and had some capital sport, but as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
were proceeding along in high spirits at our
success, I started a magnificent animal. I had
a shot at him, but was not near enough to do
him any mischief. As the tiger was stealing
off towards Lord Muligatawny, he fired; but
whether it was his mismanagement of the gun,
or proceeded from his elephant&rsquo;s suddenly backing
at the approach of the tiger, I cannot say;
but certain it is Lord Muligatawny was tumbled
off his elephant, and in another moment the
tiger was upon him. &lsquo;Now we shall see if the
tiger will bolt,&rsquo; thought I; and he did bolt:
but he bolted with Lord Muligatawny! He
grasped his lordship by the nape of his neck at
the time he was looking as fierce as a ferret,
and flinging his body over his shoulder, he was
out of sight before any one could get a shot at
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what became of him?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the last we ever saw of Lord
Muligatawny,&rdquo; replied Sir Curry. &ldquo;But about
a week afterwards I was hunting in the neighbourhood,
when, after a capital run, and a desperate
contest, I succeeded in killing one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the finest tigers I ever saw. I had his body
taken home to show him to my friends, and
upon opening him, among the best part of a
sheep, a dog&rsquo;s hind quarters, and a litter of
sucking pigs, we found the identical snuff-box
of poor Lord Muligatawny, proving beyond
the possibility of a doubt that not only had the
tiger bolted <em>with</em> his lordship, but that he had
had the audacity to make a bolt <em>of</em> him. But
come and hunt&mdash;come and hunt&mdash;I will show
you some capital sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as you showed Lord Muligatawny, I
suppose,&rdquo; said the young merchant, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, there&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; replied his host;
and then taking an air-gun of a peculiar construction
towards his visitor, added, &ldquo;Now, look
at this weapon&mdash;one of the best of the kind ever
made. This is fixed on a swivel in the carriage
in which you sit on the elephant; and you are
quite safe, and, if you are a tolerable marksman,
are sure to wound your game. Besides this,
the hunter generally has a strong short sword,
like this,&rdquo; said he, producing a weapon of that
description. &ldquo;Very sharp and very useful too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
for if the tiger leaps on the elephant, which he
will frequently do, the hunter with a good blow
at his head may settle his business. Come and
hunt, man, come and hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound these mosquitoes!&rdquo; exclaimed
the professor in a rage, vainly endeavouring to
drive the insects from about him, and making
the most ludicrous grimaces, as in spite of his
exertions they succeeded in biting the exposed
part of his head. &ldquo;These horrible things will
torment me to death. Ever since I have been
in this deplorable country, my head has been
besieged by thousands of them. They don&rsquo;t
let me rest a minute. Ah! What a gripe! I
shall go mad! They&rsquo;ll torment me to death; I
can&rsquo;t endure it, Sir Curry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to it,&rdquo; said his host,
quietly. &ldquo;This is the way they always use
strangers. You are fresh meat to them. But
come and hunt&mdash;come and hunt; I&rsquo;ll have the
elephants got ready for you immediately, and
it&rsquo;s a capital day for the sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, gentlemen? Shall we hunt
the tiger?&rdquo; asked Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather you would hunt the musquitoes,&rdquo;
said Fortyfolios, seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, Zabra?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish it, Oriel,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not the slightest objection, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; observed the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let it be, Sir Curry,&rdquo; said Oriel.</p>

<p>Orders were instantly given to the servants,
a crowd of dark Hindoos, in white turbans, short
frocks fastened round the middle with a sash,
and with bare arms and legs, who lost no time
in making the necessary preparations.</p>

<p>Three elephants were caparisoned and led
round to the front of the house. Sir Curry
mounted the largest, and Fortyfolios and Tourniquet,
after some trouble, managed to get firm
sitting on another. While these preparations
were making, Zabra had been amusing himself
by feeding the remaining elephant with sweetmeats.
She was a small but exceedingly docile
animal; and seemed to enjoy the sort of food
with which she was indulged with a particular
gusto, swinging her body with a regular oscillatory
movement, and twisting her trunk up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
down with ceaseless activity. The order having
been given her to kneel, the two friends
mounted; and, accompanied by a few attendants,
skilful in the management of the hunt,
the party moved forward into an open park, in
which several blue-skinned buffaloes and humped
bullocks, with here and there a few deer, were
seen endeavouring to find a cool place in the
shadows of the trees. The day was excessively
hot; and the oppressive sultriness of the atmosphere
seemed to be felt by every living thing,
except the mosquitoes, who flew about in myriads,
plaguing both man and beast. In passing
a large tank the cattle were frequently seen
rushing into it, where they would remain with
nothing but their noses above the water, in
hopes of escaping from those tormenting insects;
but Fortyfolios appeared to be the especial object
of their attacks, for his hands were constantly
employed in trying to drive them from his face.
They passed many clumps of lofty cocoa-nut
trees, in which troops of monkeys were skipping
about from branch to branch, and chattering at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the hunters with more volubility than harmony;
and, after proceeding along fields of rice, indigo,
and Indian corn, surrounded by hedges of aloes
and bamboo, they approached a marsh, watered
by a branch of the Ganges, in which several large
crocodiles, troops of adjutants, and different
species of snakes were observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of game here, you see!&rdquo;
remarked Sir Curry to his companions. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s wonderful the difficulty I have to preserve
it; poaching prevails to a great extent in spite
of the severity of our game laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No reply was made to the observation; and
the party passed on, making their way with
great difficulty through a forest of banyans,
occasionally taking a shot at a stray jackal or a
wandering vulture, till they descended a steep
declivity, overgrown with thick underwood, over
which trees of immense proportions spread their
gigantic branches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we shall soon beat up the game,&rdquo; said
Sir Curry: &ldquo;we are entering a famous preserve
of tigers. About half a mile further in the
jungle we shall come to the very place where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
lost poor Lord Muligatawny. Very interesting
spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortyfolios at least did not seem to care for
the interest of the place, and he regretted ever
having left the safe quarters of Sir Curry Rajah&rsquo;s
country-house, to wander on the back of
an elephant through marshes, and forests, and
jungles, infested with every species of venomous
and savage creatures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot see what pleasure there can be in
exposing one&rsquo;s life in this way. It&rsquo;s the most
foolish thing I ever heard of,&rdquo; said he to his
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancients were much greater fools,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied Tourniquet. &ldquo;They
would break their necks after a wretched fox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the fox couldn&rsquo;t eat the hunter, and
the tiger can,&rdquo; added the other seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is the greater necessity for
killing the tiger, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; rejoined the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why not exterminate the breed? They
must be very destructive to the flocks and herds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
as well as to human beings who happen to fall in
their way; yet this man actually preserves them
for the sake of the sport they afford,&rdquo; said the
professor, with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so did the ancients with their foxes,&rdquo;
replied his companion. &ldquo;They were very destructive
to the poultry of the neighbouring
farmers; they were perfectly worthless; their
skins were of no value, and their flesh not
eatable; yet they were carefully preserved for
the sport they afforded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiger!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Curry, who was a
little in advance of the party, as he pointed to
some animal, the form of which could not be
clearly distinguished, stealing through the high
grass and reeds with which they were surrounded.
Several shots were fired at him; but
he bounded away as if unhurt, and the elephants
proceeded in pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiger!&rdquo; again shouted their host, and
another was observed making off in a contrary
direction; but he escaped before a gun could be
discharged.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry began to feel a little excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and took more interest in the hunt than he had
previously experienced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios, as loud as he
could scream; and, upon looking round to observe
what was the matter, the hunters beheld
a large monkey, as the professor was passing
underneath the branch of a tree, swinging by
his tail, dart down, and snatch the straw hat
that Fortyfolios wore to shield his head from
the sun&rsquo;s rays, with which he made an immediate
retreat, grinning and chattering among
his companions as if congratulating himself on
the cleverness by which he had acquired the
prize. The whole troop were immediately in
commotion, scrambling with one another for
possession of the spoil; till the thief, finding
he was likely to lose the result of his dexterity,
placed the hat on his own head, and darted off,
from branch to branch, with inconceivable rapidity,
pursued by the other monkeys with a
chorus of yells absolutely deafening.</p>

<p>Fortyfolios looked the very picture of mute
despair when he found his bald head exposed
to the attacks of the relentless mosquitoes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
was obliged to bind it with a handkerchief.
His disquietude did not decrease, when, a few
paces farther on, his eyes fell upon the form of
a monstrous snake, twined round the stem of
an immense tree, which, with arched head,
glaring eyes, and protruded sting, seemed about
to spring upon the unhappy professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty of game here, gentlemen; capital
preserve,&rdquo; observed Sir Curry very coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven preserve me!&rdquo; emphatically exclaimed
Fortyfolios, trembling in every joint.</p>

<p>Tourniquet fired at the monster, and he immediately
glided away into the deepest recesses
of the jungle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiger!&rdquo; shouted Sir Curry, as one made
its appearance within a few yards of his elephant.
Oriel fired, and hit him. Sir Curry
fired at the same time, and lodged a bullet in
his shoulder. The animal, smarting with the
pain and howling with rage, made a spring at
Sir Curry, which brought him within reach of
his &ldquo;tiger-slayer,&rdquo; as he called it; and a ferocious
blow, well directed, sent him with another
howl to the feet of the elephant, who kept him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
between her hind legs and her fore legs till she
had kicked him to death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine beast!&rdquo; said Sir Curry Rajah, noticing
its size; &ldquo;but this place is famous for such
game. By the bye, this is the identical spot in
which I lost poor Lord Muligatawny. He was
sitting on his elephant just where sits our friend
the professor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he fell into the jaws of the tiger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor shuddered and looked very
pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiger!&rdquo; shouted Sir Curry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; screamed Fortyfolios; and if
Tourniquet had not laid hold of him he would
have tumbled off his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised a man of your sense should
show so much fear, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; observed
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not fear, Doctor Tourniquet,&rdquo; replied
the professor, endeavouring to conceal his alarm
with all the philosophy he possessed. &ldquo;I do
not care about death, but I have a reasonable
objection to being devoured. As for the quality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
impression, or emotion, which is usually called
fear, in a philosophical sense, I deny that in
me it has ever had existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiger!&rdquo; again shouted Sir Curry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; again screamed the professor;
and he trembled so violently that he caught
hold of the framework of the seat to secure
his position on the elephant. The game now
became very plentiful; and the hunt was followed
from one jungle through open vistas into
another. Oriel entered into the pursuit with
ardour, but Zabra did not appear to join in
it with the least interest. He seemed to entertain
the same objection to being devoured as
Fortyfolios, or else his anxiety for the safety of
his companion destroyed all pleasure in the
chase. He became restless and uneasy; but
Oriel was so actively engaged in looking for and
despatching the game, that he did not notice
the disquietude of his friend. They had killed
several tigers; and, having pursued a very
large one out of the jungle into an open valley,
he there made a stand before a large banyan
tree. The hunters surrounded him, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
crouching, lashing himself with his tail, and
preparing for a spring, as they approached. As
soon as they came within shooting distance,
Oriel, Sir Curry, and Dr. Tourniquet, fired;
instantly, with a low half-stifled growl, the tiger
gave two or three prodigious bounds, and
leaped upon the elephant upon which Zabra
was sitting; and immediately afterwards both
were rolling together among the long grass.
The elephant, as soon as she observed Zabra&rsquo;s
danger, as if in gratitude for the attentions she
had received from him before starting for the
hunt, turned round and ran at the tiger as if
with the intention of trampling him down. The
young merchant, in the anguish of the moment,
at seeing his friend in the power of the ferocious
beast, had at first lost his presence of
mind, but observing that the elephant had succeeded
in drawing the attention of the tiger
from his victim, he slipped off her back, and,
with no other weapon than his hunting sword,
advanced to the place where the animal stood.
The elephant had made two or three rushes at
the tiger, but had not succeeded in getting him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
under her feet, and he was still crouching beside
the prostrate body of Zabra, when he observed
the approach of Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have a shot at him, Master Porphyry,&rdquo;
exclaimed his host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be killed, don&rsquo;t you see, if you
attack him with such a useless weapon?&rdquo; shouted
Tourniquet. Oriel still advanced with his
sword firmly grasped, his arm raised, and his
gaze fixed upon that of the tiger. The savage
beast curved his back and lashed his tail; his
fur became erect, and his eyes seemed flashing
with an expression of the most terrible ferocity.
Oriel Porphyry still moved forward; and as
the tiger, with a low sharp growl, made a
bound towards him, he leaped on one side,
and turning quickly round dealt a blow with
all his force, that severed the tendons of the
animal&rsquo;s leg, as he reached the ground.
The brute howled with pain, and rushed with
open mouth upon his antagonist. The wound
he had received prevented him from making a
spring, but he dashed furiously forward upon
three legs, with looks intent upon mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>At this instant, the elephant made a rush at
the tiger, and tumbled him over to a considerable
distance. Oriel again advanced towards
him; and lashing himself into a fiercer rage,
the wounded beast prepared to dig his claws
and teeth into the body of his pursuer; but the
young merchant avoided all the desperate attempts
the savage creature made to fasten upon
him, and inflicted upon his head and legs several
severe wounds; then, watching his opportunity,
he brought down the sword with all his
strength upon his skull, and the tiger fell dead
at his feet.</p>

<p>When he turned round to hasten to Zabra&rsquo;s
assistance, he found the elephant trying to
raise him from the ground with her trunk:
and she seemed as much concerned at the accident
as any person there, and moved him as
gently, and looked in his face as anxiously, as
the tenderest nurse could have done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravely fought, Master Porphyry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sir Curry. &ldquo;I never saw finer sport;
and you have shown yourself one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
hunters I ever met with. You shall have the
skin, for you&rsquo;ve well deserved it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you much hurt, my dear Zabra?&rdquo; he
anxiously inquired, without attending to his
host&rsquo;s commendations, as he bent over the
prostrate body of his friend. A low groan was
all the reply he received. &ldquo;Dr. Tourniquet!&rdquo;
shouted Oriel: but the doctor was standing at
his side, having hastened to the spot when he
saw that his services were likely to be required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what can be done immediately,&rdquo; added
the young merchant earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost
afraid the brute has killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as that, don&rsquo;t you see, for
he breathes,&rdquo; observed the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But his dress is all over blood; therefore
he must have received some dangerous wounds,&rdquo;
added Oriel. &ldquo;Here; I&rsquo;ll undo his vest; and
then we can see the extent of the injury he has
received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said the doctor, unceremoniously
pushing him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Tourniquet, you behave very
strangely, I think,&rdquo; said the other, seemingly
much offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, Master Porphyry,&rdquo; responded
the doctor, apparently with much
confusion; &ldquo;but it would be very dangerous
to meddle with the wounds now, don&rsquo;t you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They surely ought to be dressed without
loss of time,&rdquo; remarked the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The patient has received a severe shock;
and the state of the atmosphere, and&mdash;and
not having with me things necessary to dress
the wound, and&mdash;and many other things,
make it advisable that the patient should be
put to bed before his hurts are examined,&rdquo; said
the doctor, attempting to hide his perplexity
as well as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say, I think it very strange,&rdquo; observed
Oriel, not being able to account for the
embarrassment under which the doctor was
evidently labouring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm done, I hope?&rdquo; inquired Sir
Curry, as he approached upon his elephant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
&ldquo;I should be sorry to have another Lord
Muligatawny affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing what harm has been
done; for I really cannot get my surgeon to
ascertain,&rdquo; replied the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! ah! that&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; responded his
host: &ldquo;I always like to know the worst. It&rsquo;s
a great consolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us get out of this horrid place, or we
shall all be eaten up by wild beasts,&rdquo; exclaimed
Fortyfolios, who was sitting, disconsolate and
uneasy on the top of his elephant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a thing might be. I&rsquo;ve known several
persons whose ardour in pursuit of game
has made them food for tigers,&rdquo; remarked Sir
Curry. &ldquo;Poor Lord Muligatawny was only
one instance out of many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, he revives!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor,
directing attention to his patient, whose eyes
were gently unclosing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra! my dear Zabra! are you better?&rdquo;
asked Oriel, as he supported his young friend&rsquo;s
head on his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Zabra looked about him with a wild stare,
till his eyes fell upon the elephant, who had all
the time been an attentive spectator of the
scene, and then, as if remembering what he
had suffered, he gave a slight convulsive shudder,
and sunk back into the arms of his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tiger is dead, Zabra!&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish all tigers were dead,&rdquo; muttered
Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we had better place the patient on
yonder elephant, and I will accompany him till
we return from whence we set out, when he
can have his wounds dressed, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
said Dr. Tourniquet, who had recovered from
his confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, send him forward with some of my
people,&rdquo; added Sir Curry Rajah; &ldquo;and you
come with me, Master Porphyry, and I&rsquo;ll show
you a preserve where the tigers are as thick as
monkeys on a cocoanut tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had quite enough of tiger hunting, I
thank you,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry, very seriously;
then directing his attention to his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
friend, he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Zabra! are you better
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth opened his long eye-lashes, and
gazed upon his patron, as if recognising his
voice, and then in a low whisper said, &ldquo;Yes, I
am better, Oriel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you let Dr. Tourniquet examine your
wounds, Zabra? We want to know how much
you are hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! oh no!&rdquo; he replied hastily, &ldquo;Not
now, not now, Oriel. Not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very strange,&rdquo; observed the young
merchant, unable to find a reason for an objection
to a thing that seemed so requisite. &ldquo;Very
strange&mdash;but you can let us know what injury
you have received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My back and arms are lacerated,&rdquo; responded
Zabra. &ldquo;But they do not pain me so much
as they did. Dr. Tourniquet shall see to them
when I return, and perhaps you can allow him
to remain with me in case I should want his
assistance before. You can then return with
the professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry appeared surprised, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
gave orders to the attendants, who had been unconcerned
spectators of the scene; and, having
lifted Zabra upon the elephant, who seemed
delighted to regain his burthen, the whole party
returned to the country house of Sir Curry
Rajah.</p>

<span class="f8">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE DANGER OF GOOD
INTENTIONS.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;I tell</span> you what it is, Boggle,&rdquo; said Climberkin
to his friend, as they were pacing the
quarter-deck together, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re al&rsquo;ays getting
yourself into scrapes. You&rsquo;ve got a notion as
you can do things in the most tip top manner,
and you make a reg&rsquo;lar mommock of every
thin&rsquo; you sets about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I knows o&rsquo; the matter is, that I likes
to ha&rsquo; &rsquo;ticular notions o&rsquo; things in general, as
every man as is a man, and thinks like a man,
should,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;But I arn&rsquo;t such
a stoop as to allow every body to come his handy
dandy sugarcandy over me. I knows a marlin
spike from a gun carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was no &rsquo;casion for you to &rsquo;noy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the cap&rsquo;ain by comin&rsquo; the high and mighty
over his nevey,&rdquo; observed Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did it for the best,&rdquo; responded his
companion. &ldquo;You see the young chap arn&rsquo;t
quite up to his dooty; so I thought, as I was his
superior officer, it was the most properest thing
in natur for me to tell him what&rsquo;s what. But I
recomembered as young people has feelings,
and that it would be best to make my &rsquo;munication
as pleasant as possible; so the next time I
comed alongside Mr. Midshipman Loop, I says,
quite delicately, says I, you&rsquo;re a lubberly young
son of a sea cow, as arn&rsquo;t fit to do nuffin but
to count your fingers, or cut your toe-nails.
You&rsquo;re al&rsquo;ays a skylarking arter some precious
mischief or another. No matter whether you&rsquo;re
aloft among the reefers, or down below, right-fol-de-dolin&rsquo;
at the mess, you&rsquo;re up to no
sort o&rsquo; good whatsomdever. I arn&rsquo;t no patience
wi&rsquo; sich varmint; and if you don&rsquo;t do your dooty
in a less &rsquo;jectionable sort o&rsquo; fashion, I&rsquo;m pretty
considerably spiflicated if I don&rsquo;t make sich a
report o&rsquo; your wagabondisings as shall make you
catch more toko than you&rsquo;ll be able to digest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
a month. Well, instead of the fellow being
grateful for the handsome way in which I&rsquo;d
tried not to hurt none o&rsquo; his feelins, he looks
at me w&rsquo; as much water in his eyes as &rsquo;ould do
to wash his face in; and in a short time arterwards
up comes the cap&rsquo;ain, and gives me sich
a sittin&rsquo; down as didn&rsquo;t leave me a leg to stand
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d been too hard upon the young un,&rdquo;
observed Climberkin: &ldquo;there was no necessity
for speaking so sharp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way I gets served out whenever
I attempts to do a good action,&rdquo; replied
Boggle. &ldquo;Nobody has better intentions nor I
have; but, somehow or another, whenever I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;tempted to do a fellow a good turn, the end on
it is the treatment I meets wi&rsquo; gives me sich a
turn as puts me into a perfect &rsquo;stonishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go the right way to work, Boggle&mdash;that&rsquo;s
it, depend on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The right way!&rdquo; exclaimed Boggle. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;ve been this way, and that way, and t&rsquo;other
way&mdash;backards and forards&mdash;right and left&mdash;upside
down and round the corners; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
should like to know what other way there is in
this here univarsal world? No; the thing is
this: there&rsquo;s a plank started some where. Natur
don&rsquo;t go right wi&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;ve had a deal o&rsquo; &rsquo;sperience
in my time, and every &rsquo;dividual thing has
been sarved up to me wi&rsquo; the same sauce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear the long and the short
o&rsquo; your goin&rsquo;s on,&rdquo; said Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, I&rsquo;ve a notion the whole
circumbendibus o&rsquo; my history is as good as a
sermon,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear it then, Boggle, if you&rsquo;ve
no objection,&rdquo; added his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then here goes, if you&rsquo;ll sit down on this
gun; for, though I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo; a standin&rsquo; joke,
I should think a standin&rsquo; story would be rather
a tiresome sort o&rsquo; thing. It&rsquo;s no matter when
or where I was launched,&rdquo; continued Boggle;
&ldquo;and about my parentage, its only necessary
to say, I had a father and a mother, like other
folks. Well, in due time I was bound a &rsquo;prentice
to a ship&rsquo;s carpenter. I very early entertained
a desire to set people to rights as was goin&rsquo;
wrong. I thought there was nuffin so pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
as tryin&rsquo; to do good, and I took hold of every
&rsquo;portunity to benefit my fellow-creturs. Master
was a punch-your-head sort o&rsquo; character, wi&rsquo;
one eye and a leg-o&rsquo;-mutton fist; and missus
was a spirited little ooman, mighty famous in her
way; but if you did get in her way, she pretty
soon made you get out of it. Well, when
master wasn&rsquo;t a punchin&rsquo; my head, missus was
a boxin&rsquo; my ears; and when missus wasn&rsquo;t a
boxin&rsquo; my ears, master was a punchin&rsquo; my head;
and when they were tired o&rsquo; sarvin&rsquo; me out,
they turned to and sarved each other out. I led
a lovely life, as you may suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dog would ha&rsquo; been better off, I should
think,&rdquo; observed Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a heart overflowin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the buttermilk
o&rsquo; human kindness,&rdquo; continued the lieutenant;
&ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t like sich a state o&rsquo; things, no how.
I entertained a notion that the only way to
change this here strife was to endeavour to
create feelin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; love betwixt the parties; but
how to get &rsquo;em to like each other, instead of to
lick each other, was the difficulty. &lsquo;If I can
make &rsquo;em believe each other&rsquo;s affection, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
make a reg&rsquo;lar Cupid and physic business of it,&rsquo;
thought I. But how could I make &rsquo;em believe?
Where was the proof? I had always heard as
jealousy was a proof o&rsquo; love; so I determined to
make &rsquo;em as jealous as was possible. Well, I
took a &rsquo;casion to hint to master as missus was
unkimmonly amiable to Brisket, the butcher
over the way; and, although Brisket, the butcher
over the way, warn&rsquo;t no more a object o&rsquo; love
nor a rhinoceros, I could see master&rsquo;s one eye
flashin&rsquo; about like a bundle o&rsquo; crackers in a
kitchen fire; and he told me to watch their
canouvres and &rsquo;municate to him any thing as
was likely to interfere wi&rsquo; his conjugalities; and,
as a more nor ordinary mark o&rsquo; his &rsquo;preciation o&rsquo;
my regard for his matrimonial blessedness, he
took me a punch o&rsquo; the head twice as hard as
ever he&rsquo;d given me afore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had the luck of it!&rdquo; remarked his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I went to missus, and, in the most
delicatest manner as could be, I gave her to
suppose that there was a monstrous deal o&rsquo; improperiety
going forard betwixt master and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Mrs. Brisket, the butcher&rsquo;s wife over the way;
and, although Mrs. Brisket, the butcher&rsquo;s wife
over the way, was about as good looking as a
toad-fish, missus seemed quite done brown o&rsquo;
both sides; and, tellin&rsquo; me to gi&rsquo; her due notice
o&rsquo; their clandasterous proceedin&rsquo;s, she fetched
me a box o&rsquo; the ear, as made the inside o&rsquo; my
head seem turned into curds and whey. Well,
I continued this sort o&rsquo; game till, if jealousy be
a proof o&rsquo; love, they ought to ha&rsquo; been convinced
beyond a doubt, and, as a matter o&rsquo; course,
should have been as lovin&rsquo; as turtle-doves: but,
&rsquo;straordinary to relate, he punched her head,
and she boxed his ears, more earnestly than ever,
all the time throwing out &rsquo;sinuations that stirred
each other up into the most tarnationest fury.
One unfortunit day, when I was workin&rsquo; away
in the shop, and they were workin&rsquo; away in the
same place, they suddenly stopped their hands
to make use o&rsquo; their tongues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I knows your goin&rsquo;s on over the way, you
wretch,&rsquo; squeaked missus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I knows <em>your</em> goin&rsquo;s on over the way,
you trollope,&rsquo; bawled master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kill that woman,&rsquo; cried one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll murder Brisket!&rsquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s false, you villain! I defy you to
prove your words. But you know my suspicions
are well founded,&rsquo; exclaimed the wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s false, you hussy! and you know it,&rsquo;
shouted the husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had the intelligence from the best authority,
sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had mine from a source that dared not
deceive me, madam.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who told you?&rsquo; was simultaneously asked
by both; and &lsquo;Boggle!&rsquo; was the reply in almost
the same breath. Immediately they turned
upon me. I could see master&rsquo;s eye lookin&rsquo; at
me as if he was about to walk down my throat;
and missus&mdash;but it&rsquo;s only necessary to say
that I made a sudden bolt between master&rsquo;s
legs, managed to tumble him over her; and
while they were sprawlin&rsquo; together, I was
crossin&rsquo; all manner o&rsquo; streets, at a pace that
sent every body out o&rsquo; my way. That was the
end o&rsquo; my &rsquo;prenticeship; and thus my good
intentions were so &rsquo;bominably frusterated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do then?&rdquo; inquired
Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to live wi&rsquo; an uncle,&rdquo; replied Boggle.
&ldquo;He kept a knife-and-forkery. Meat of all
kinds, ready cooked, was waiting for the
hungry at any hour, with vegetables in season
and out o&rsquo; season; soups of all sorts, and some of
very strange sorts; with mustard, bread, pepper,
and salt. I continued at this business a considerable
time, and liked it much better nor
the ship carpenterin&rsquo;; and I gained a good
many &rsquo;ticular notions o&rsquo; things in general:
indeed, I may say, without any sinnivation
against the sort o&rsquo; meat we sold, as how I
became a slap bang judge o&rsquo; horse-flesh. I still
continued &rsquo;deavourin&rsquo; to set things right as was
goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;other way; but the same sort o&rsquo; fun
al&rsquo;ays happened as when I &rsquo;tempted to make
jealousy become a proof o&rsquo; love: I got no
more gratitude nor would serve a flea to lie
down upon. Well, it so happened as our customers
was frequently in the habit o&rsquo; complainin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; dyspepsia. Every body had dyspepsia:
long or short, little or big, fat or lean, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
mortal cretur talked o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else but his
dyspepsia. Some said it was all acause o&rsquo;
their diet, and they detarmined to make a
reg&rsquo;lar change in their eatables; so havin&rsquo; been
used to nothin&rsquo; else but mutton and beef, they
directly began to eat nothin&rsquo; else but beef and
mutton. And some said it was one thing, and
some said it was another; and some said it was
just exactly neither. Now, I knowed about as
much o&rsquo; dyspepsia as I did o&rsquo; the top o&rsquo; the
moon; but I seed as there was a screw loose
somewhere, and I was nat&rsquo;rally anxious to put
it in proper order. So I got hold of a book
as gived explanations in the most popular incomprehensible
manner about diet and regimen,
and what you should eat and what you shouldn&rsquo;t
eat; and how much you might put in your
bread-room, and how much you might let
alone; and there I met with the whole complete
circumbendibus about dyspepsia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was it?&rdquo; inquired his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t exactly say what it was,&rdquo;
replied Boggle, &ldquo;acause the book didn&rsquo;t exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
tell me; but I found out as every fellow as had
it should be reg&rsquo;lar as clock-work in his eatables,
and should have no more nor a sartain
quantity at no time. So I began &rsquo;deavourin&rsquo; to
cure the dyspepsia. I hadn&rsquo;t the power to
make &rsquo;em reg&rsquo;late their jaw tackle accordin&rsquo; to
the book; but I took precious good care as
every one should have a sartain quantity.
Whether a fellow could eat a horse, or hadn&rsquo;t
a appetite no more nor a blue bottle, I sarved
&rsquo;em all wi&rsquo; a sartain quantity. Acause why?
It was good for their dyspepsia. But they
kicked up such a bobbery! The big eaters got
into a devourin&rsquo; rage, and they left the shop,
swearing I was a tryin&rsquo; to pick their pockets.
Ungrateful wretches! I was only a tryin&rsquo; to
cure their dyspepsia. And the little eaters
were so very few in comparison, that, if they
had remained satisfied wi&rsquo; my treatment, their
custom would have been of no sort o&rsquo; significance;
but, acause I gived them more nor their
money&rsquo;s worth, they quitted the place, saying
it was too cheap to be good, and that I was
only a wantin&rsquo; to poisen &rsquo;em. Ignorant creturs!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
I was only a wantin&rsquo; to cure their dyspepsia!
Well, my uncle was in a reg&rsquo;lar take in at the
loss o&rsquo; his business: it put him into as complete
a botheration as ever you seed. He was a man
o&rsquo; very few words, but was unkimmon handy
upon occasions; and, seein&rsquo; or fancyin&rsquo; summut
wasn&rsquo;t correct, he watched my goin&rsquo;s on; and
one day he cotched me a sarving out a sartain
quantity to a fellow who didn&rsquo;t want quite so
much. So he axed me what I was arter; and
I up and I told him all about the dyspepsia;
and all about my attemptin&rsquo; to cure it; and all
about my sarvin&rsquo; out a sartain quantity to
every body as comed to the shop. Well, afore
I&rsquo;d got to the end o&rsquo; my story, my uncle, in
the most unnat&rsquo;ral way as could be, took up a
stick as was handy, and he sarved <em>me</em> out wi&rsquo; a
sartain quantity, till I was obligated to make all
sail out o&rsquo; the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordin&rsquo; to my notions, it wasn&rsquo;t a bit more
nor you deserved,&rdquo; remarked the unsympathising
Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, not for trying to cure the dyspepsia!&rdquo;
loudly exclaimed the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for trying to cure nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;But what became o&rsquo; you arter that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my friends thought my notions o&rsquo;
things in general not likely to come to no good
ashore, so they took it into their heads to send
me afloat,&rdquo; responded his companion. &ldquo;My
first voyage lasted long enough to give me a
tolerable smartish insight into the nautical; but
I was continually wantin&rsquo; to set things right,
and my good intentions were as continually a
sarving me out wi&rsquo; a sartain quantity. Now,
this might ha&rsquo; made any fellow but me tired o&rsquo;
tryin&rsquo; to benefit his fellow-creturs: but I wasn&rsquo;t
a chap o&rsquo; that sort; and I still went on, as sarcumstances
required, &rsquo;tempting to do lots o&rsquo; good,
and gettin&rsquo; in return nothin&rsquo; but lots o&rsquo; bad.
Well, when I came ashore in my native place,
I was rather a hold-your-head-up sort o&rsquo; young
chap; and, havin&rsquo; some money to spend, I swaggered
about the streets most consumedly, and
fancied as every gal I cotched sight on was
thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; in natur&rsquo; but lookin&rsquo; arter me.
So I thought as a matter o&rsquo; course I&rsquo;d look arter
them. I just did. As I had &rsquo;ticular notions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
o&rsquo; things in general, as every man as is a man,
and thinks like a man, should have, I thought
it would be cruel to the rest o&rsquo; the she creturs
if I confined my attentions to one: consequently,
I went a courtin&rsquo; away like a steam-engine
to all as I could meet. I had &rsquo;em o&rsquo; all sorts
and sizes, colours and complexions&mdash;scraggy
or squab&mdash;longs or shorts&mdash;it made not a bit
o&rsquo; difference&mdash;as long as they were inclined to
be fond o&rsquo; me, I was inclined to be fond o&rsquo; them.
I had the best intentions&mdash;I thought o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;
but makin&rsquo; &rsquo;em happy; and the more happiness
as I could make, the more good I thought
I was a doing. Well, somehow or other, things
began to look queer, and every one on &rsquo;em was
a wantin&rsquo; me to marry &rsquo;em. Now, there was a
law again a fellow marryin&rsquo; more nor one wife;
and I knew as if I married one it would be unkimmonly
unjust to the rest. This my &rsquo;ticular
notion o&rsquo; things in general wouldn&rsquo;t allow. I
still entertained the best intentions; so thinkin&rsquo;
as if they knowed the rights o&rsquo; the case they
would see the impossibility o&rsquo; my agreein&rsquo; to
their wishes, I, unbeknown to the others, invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
every one to meet me under a large tree,
a little way out o&rsquo; the town, in the branches o&rsquo;
which I hid myself very snug, to diskiver the
upshot. First one came&mdash;then came another&mdash;and
number one looked at number two in
all sorts o&rsquo; ways. Then came a third, and the
two looked at number three in all sorts o&rsquo; ways.
Then came a fourth, a fifth, a sixth&mdash;ay, I may
as well acknowledge at once as how they came
to a matter o&rsquo; twenty; and they all looked at
one another in all sorts o&rsquo; ways. At last, one
on &rsquo;em, as I knowed to be a bit o&rsquo; a spit-fire,
spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;may I ask what
brought you all here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I came to meet Boggle,&rsquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I came to meet Boggle,&rsquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I came to meet Boggle,&rsquo; said all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You came to meet Boggle, you hussy!&rsquo;
exclaimed every one in the whole lot; and, in
less than a jiffy, caps flew about, dresses were
torn, and there was the most considerable shindy
that ever was known in this here univarsal
world. Now, I had the best intentions. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
only thought o&rsquo; creatin&rsquo; as much happiness as I
could. I never had no suspicion as my notions
o&rsquo; things in general could ha&rsquo; led to such a
revolution. And when I seed &rsquo;em all one a
top o&rsquo; t&rsquo; other, a pummelling, a scratching, and
screeching like so many wild cats, I was taken quite
comical; and, missing my hold upon the bough,
I tumbled right down into the very midst on &rsquo;em.
Directly as they caught eyes o&rsquo; me they left off
fighting. &lsquo;I shall settle the matter comfortably
at last,&rsquo; thought I. Miserable Boggle that I
was! how I did deceive myself! In the next
moment they all flew at me like a lot o&rsquo; tigers,
and they scratched me up, and they scratched
me down, and they scratched me sideways&mdash;they
pulled every hair out o&rsquo; my head, and they
tore my clothes into bits not big enough to
cover a pincushion; and they didn&rsquo;t leave my
unfortunate body till they thought they had
killed me out and out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think that ought to have sickened
you o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; a courtin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked Climberkin,
unable to restrain his mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sickened!&rdquo; exclaimed the other; &ldquo;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
very sight o&rsquo; a she cretur makes me as good as
done for. Why, I was obliged to be laid up in
lavender for a month. I became as tender as a
chicken, and every bone I possessed seemed to
have been smashed into porridge. And this was
all in return for my &rsquo;deavourin&rsquo; to make &rsquo;em
happy! If this arn&rsquo;t a most ungrateful world
I&rsquo;m a nigger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what followed this adventure?&rdquo; inquired
his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; replied Boggle, very
gravely: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the heart to go on. But
it was all the same. Still from time to time I
thought o&rsquo; setting things to rights; and on every
&rsquo;portunity I was rewarded for my good intentions
wi&rsquo; exactly a similar sort o&rsquo; treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes the governor!&rdquo; said the other,
as he noticed Oriel and his party approaching;
and the two young men hastily left their seats
on the gun-carriage to attend to their duty in
the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What coast is this, captain,&rdquo; asked the
young merchant, pointing to the shore that lay
at the distance of a few miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the coast of Arabia,&rdquo; replied Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A part of the world rendered particularly
interesting to the philosopher by the many important
incidents which, from the early history
of the world, have there occurred,&rdquo; added the
professor. &ldquo;Here the chariots of Pharaoh,
pursuing the fugitive Jews, were ingulfed in the
waters of the Red Sea; and yonder is the land
where, after their escape, the children of Israel
wandered during their weary pilgrimage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the religion of Moses may be said to
have had its origin here; and here, also, the
religion of Mahomet was created, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
remarked the doctor. &ldquo;This is the land of
Mecca and Medina: this is the land which,
during the darkness of the middle ages, evinced
the first dawn of civilisation that gave light to
the world&mdash;the land of Arabian literature&mdash;of
Arabian chivalry&mdash;of Arabian science and
art. I cannot say that I honour the character
of their prophet; and I detest the way in which
his religion was promulgated as I detest every
religion or every form of faith that may be
called a religion, which has had its foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
upon bloodshed, rapine, and persecution. But,
looking to the effects produced by the diffusion
of the absurdities of the Koran wherever the
arms of the Mahometans could penetrate, I
must say that it has created more good than
many religions which have since obtained more
consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! shall the Barbarians who destroyed
the Alexandrian library be held up to admiration?&rdquo;
exclaimed Fortyfolios, indignantly.
&ldquo;Shall they who desolated wherever they went,
among those who would not acknowledge their
pretended prophet, be considered benefactors to
their species? I cannot think you are in earnest,
Doctor Tourniquet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am in earnest, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied
the doctor. &ldquo;I would take and compare
the state of Mahometanism in Arabia, with the
state of Christianity at the same time in any
part of the world&mdash;suppose we say from the
commencement of the seventh century, during
the rule of the Abbaside caliphs, till as late as
the reign of the Ommeyide caliphs in Spain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must look to the opposite shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
for the land from which all intelligence proceeded,&rdquo;
observed the professor. &ldquo;Egypt was
the cradle of the arts and sciences; and her advances
in knowledge preceded those of Arabia
by many centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, doubtless, the advances made in India
and China preceded those of Egypt by about
the same time, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; added the doctor.
&ldquo;If we would seek the origin of philosophy, we
must, of course, find it among the first people;
and there is every reason to suppose that the
earliest inhabitants of this globe were located
in India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is doubtful,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;But the Egyptians are at least entitled to
the credit of having, at an early period, carried
the mechanical arts to purposes the magnitude
of which have never been exceeded; and the
degree of excellence they attained in philosophy
and learning is sufficient to make us regard them
with a profound veneration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can only judge of the tree by the fruit,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; responded Tourniquet. &ldquo;All
I know is, that the Egyptians distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
themselves by erecting the most magnificent
fooleries that had ever been conceived. Of
what use were their pyramids&mdash;their colossal
statues and stupendous monuments&mdash;their
gigantic idols&mdash;their vast temples, and elaborate
sculptures? Superior knowledge did exist
certainly, for they were the teachers of the
Jews and of the Greeks; and, although the
latter surpassed their instructors, they have still
a claim upon our admiration. But the priests
were the depositors of this knowledge, and
they wrapped it up in mystery so cleverly, that
it was of no use to the people, among whom it
ought to have been distributed, and was of just
the same advantage to posterity when both
priests and people were crumbling into dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we not approaching the grand water
communication that carries the Red Sea into
the Mediterranean?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s some sense in that!&rdquo; exclaimed
the doctor. &ldquo;It beats the wonders of
Thebes to nothing; and yet there could not
have been more labour employed upon it than
must have been used to erect that vast city.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Under what circumstances did it originate?&rdquo;
asked the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the Russians had made themselves
masters of Constantinople,&rdquo; said Fortyfolios,
&ldquo;the Turkish empire gradually dwindled into
insignificance; but the territory of their conquerors
had become so immense, that it was
impossible, even at the expense of a military
power scarcely ever equalled, to keep it together.
Symptoms of dissolution began to
show themselves. The native Russians, who
had gradually risen from a state of abject servitude
to one in which a strong love of liberty
became its greatest characteristic, grew restless
and dissatisfied with their government, and
were continually endeavouring to force it to become
more liberal. The frequent disturbances
which arose in consequence kept the country
very unsettled; and there was a powerful party
in the state, that, being opposed to the policy
of those in authority, aided in creating the
public disaffection. At this time, when the
government was fully employed by its own
internal disorganisation, several of the conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
provinces threw off their allegiance.
Of these, the most successful were Poland and
Greece. There arose amongst the Greeks a
man of extraordinary valour, wisdom, and soldiership,
who, from the petty leader of an insurrection,
had become the chief of the national
armies; and, having succeeded in driving the
Russians from his country, was unanimously
elected its king. But the independence of
Greece did not satisfy the ambition of this conqueror.
He knew that the military ardour of
his countrymen required to be constantly exercised;
and, leaving his kingdom to the wisdom
of his counsellors, he led a mighty armament
into the enemy&rsquo;s possessions in Turkey. Battle
after battle was here fought with the same
result. The heroic Greeks drove all before
them; besieged and took Constantinople, in
which they planted a colony; conquered their
way through Asia Minor, and, entering the
subjected province of Persia, excited the inhabitants
to revolt: nor did they desist from
their triumphant career till they had become
masters of the walls of Petersburgh. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
same time the Poles, having taken up arms,
they not only succeeded in relieving their country
from the iron bondage in which it had so
long been enslaved, but, in concert with the
Greeks, invaded the lands of their conquerors,
and in many a sanguinary battle revenged the
wrongs they had endured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the Greek conqueror stop when he had
subdued the Russians?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry,
who seemed to listen with intense interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No conqueror will halt in his career while
he imagines there is any thing to subdue,&rdquo; replied
Fortyfolios. &ldquo;The devotion with which
the Greeks regarded their chief gave him absolute
power over the lives and liberties of his
subjects, and they wanted no inducement to
follow him in the pursuit of glory. Wherever
he led they crowded to his standard. He had
but to declare his wish and armies were at his
command. At this period Egypt was a fertile and
flourishing kingdom. The English and French
had vainly endeavoured to subdue it. They
had made conquests and formed settlements:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
but when these two great empires decayed, the
conquests were given up, and the settlements
abandoned. Since then, under its own rulers,
the people had advanced in prosperity, and had
become powerful among the surrounding nations.
This country the Greeks invaded. They met
with desperate resistance; but after a frightful
destruction of human life, and making the prosperous
kingdom a wilderness, they succeeded in
bringing the Egyptians into subjection, and
planted a colony near the mouths of the Nile.
This new colony throve rapidly; as after the
death of the conqueror a long interval of peace
ensued, and the population increasing rapidly,
thousands emigrated to the shores of Egypt
and of Turkey. In little more than a century
the colonies threw off the supremacy of the
mother-country, and although many attempts
were made to force them to acknowledge their
dependency, they did not succeed, and now they
have become free states, scarcely inferior in importance
to the great empires of Columbia and
Australia; while of the great European nations
that flourished a thousand years ago, Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Italy, and Portugal, are in a semi-barbarous
condition; France, after having tried a hundred
different forms of government, is split into a
dozen little republics, each trying to destroy
the other, and all acknowledging the supremacy
of the German empire, the most powerful of
the European states, having a territory stretching
from the Rhine to the Vistula and from the
English channel to the Adriatic sea. The state
of England you will be better able to comprehend
during the visit you are about to make to its
shores than any description I can give you: but
I must return to the Greek colony in Egypt.
Its population increased rapidly, and the intelligence
of the people seemed to increase with
their numbers. They built many new cities,
but by far the largest and most magnificent of
them is the city of Athenia, which was erected
on the borders of the lake Menzaleb. The
colonists having turned their attention to commerce,
for many years had considered the advantages
that would accrue to their city if they
could open a communication with the Mediterranean
on one side, and with the Gulf of Suez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
on the other. This idea, if it were practicable,
they saw would give them facilities of traffic
which no country could surpass; and all their
thoughts were anxiously turned towards the
realisation of this splendid scheme. But the
project was so gigantic that the most skilful
engineers pronounced it impracticable. At last,
one more bold than the rest published a plan
by which he said it might be accomplished,
with an enormous capital, a considerable interval
of time, and the application of immense
labour. The plan was considered, and, after
much discussion, approved of. Funds were collected,
a multitude of labourers were employed,
and the work commenced by cutting a
broad channel through the Isthmus of Suez,
and from the Lake to the Mediterranean. In
twenty years from its commencement the waters
mingled together, and in fifty years Athenia
was one of the busiest sea-ports, and one of
the most magnificent cities in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And its inhabitants are the wisest and the
happiest people on the globe, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
added the doctor. &ldquo;They allow no superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
follies to cramp the energies of their minds.
They act and think as become men and not
slaves. Their laws are simple, few, and admirably
adapted to their wants. Their sociality
is perfect, their morality unrivalled, their intelligence
exceeds that of any other people
beneath the sun. As for their form of faith,
nothing can equal its philosophy, for they maintain
that philanthropy is the only religion, and
that the true worship of God is doing good to
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are the principles my father entertains,&rdquo;
observed the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may truly be called a nation of philanthropists,&rdquo;
continued the surgeon. &ldquo;There
is philanthropy in their laws&mdash;there is philanthropy
in their government&mdash;there is philanthropy
in their dealings one with another. From
the cradle to the grave the object of all is to teach
good or to practise it; and such things as hate,
deceit, envy, avarice, and all the black catalogue
of vices that stain other nations are to
them unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are a people worthy of being studied,&rdquo;
said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studied! they ought to be got by heart,
by every nation on the face of the globe, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; replied Dr. Tourniquet. &ldquo;There is
nothing in nature so refreshing to the sight.
It makes one in love with humanity. It dissolves
all the freezing selfishness that the prejudices
of education have created upon our
feelings, and allows us to enjoy the sunshine
and the gladness of a free and unalterable sympathy
for all our race. It is under such circumstances,
and under such only, that man
becomes what he was created to be&mdash;a creature
eminently happy, enjoying moderately all his
inclinations, pleased with the pleasures of
others, and liberally sharing his own: knowing
neither fear, nor crime, nor want, nor folly;
suffering from few diseases, and those only the
most ordinary afflictions of existence; entertaining
no idea of emulation but that of endeavouring
to exceed one another in doing good;
having no interest in any property apart from
the interest of the community; possessing no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
attachment to any object or place which is not
shared by those around him&mdash;and while looking
neither to the past nor to the future with
either hope or fear, endeavouring to make the
present as beneficial to himself and others, as
with a kind, a just, and a reasonable way of
life the present can be made. And this is what
I call a perfect state of society, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XI" id="CHAP_XI">CHAP. XI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ATHENIA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A party</span>, consisting of the two philosophers,
Oriel Porphyry, Zabra, and a stranger, were
proceeding in an elegant open carriage through
the crowded streets of Athenia. The stranger
was a man of about fifty, of noble mien, and
lofty stature. There was a classic purity in
the outline of his face, that became more
pleasing to the gazer from its being accompanied
by features of the most benevolent
expression. A mild and graceful spirit seemed
shining in every look; and none could behold
his clear expansive forehead without feeling a
conviction that he stood in the presence of an
intelligence of the highest order. A white
turban was carefully folded over his brows,
covering the lower portion of a small velvet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
cap that fitted close to the head. The upper
part of his body was robed in several vests, or
short jackets, made of different stuffs, in
elegant patterns, each being of a different
fabric and colour; and beneath these an under
garment, of remarkably fine linen, might be
observed. The waist was bound round with a
rich silken sash, the ends of which hung down
on the left side; and below it, in very full folds,
descended to the knees a garment of a thick
fabric, of a white colour till near the skirt,
where there appeared three narrow bands of
light blue: leggings of thin silk descended to
the feet, which were cased in shoes of fine
leather; and an ample robe of embroidered
purple cloth hung loose from the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a magnificent street,&rdquo; remarked the
young merchant, noticing a line of palaces that
stretched for a considerable distance on each
side of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What noble porticoes&mdash;what lofty domes&mdash;what
a beauty and harmony there is in the
arrangement of every building!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Zabra. &ldquo;Surely they are inhabited by a race
of princes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what are usually called princes, we
know nothing,&rdquo; said the stranger mildly.
&ldquo;This is the street of our great men. Here
dwell our most illustrious poets, philosophers,
artists, and men of science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo; asked Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;How do they manage to acquire such splendid
dwellings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a citizen has shown by his works,&rdquo;
resumed the stranger, &ldquo;that he possesses those
intellectual powers that most ennoble human
nature, the public, out of gratitude for the
gratifications they receive from his superior
intelligence, place him in a situation where he
can be most honoured, and where his own pleasures
may correspond in degree with the pleasures
he is creating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more wise, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
said the doctor; &ldquo;and it has been a disgrace to
all civilised nations that their men of intellect,
the only nobles that any society can possess,
have been so little cared for, that few have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
ever enjoyed an adequate return for the labour
and the wealth they were bestowing upon their
country. Rarely have they been held in the
estimation which their superiority in the only
true greatness which can distinguish humanity
ought to command; and a vast number have
been left to battle with a selfish world, till,
having endured every species of suffering that
can most afflict their sensitive natures, steeped
to the lips in poverty, weary and heartbroken,
they lie down in some obscure corner
and die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could not practise such injustice,&rdquo;
observed the stranger; &ldquo;and I am surprised
that any people should exist who know so little
of their true interests as to act in so unwise a
manner. It is our object to enlighten the
community as much as may be possible; and
knowing that the increase of intelligence, when
properly directed, is productive of a similar
increase of happiness, we naturally endeavour
to testify to those who are labouring to produce
our felicity the interest we take in the
creation of theirs: we therefore consider them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
as benefactors, clothe them with dignity, surround
them with honour, allow them to have
no want ungratified, and convey within their
reach every enjoyment that can make their
lives glide on without a care, a regret, or a
disappointment. The consequence has been,
that the gifted, observing the estimation in
which excellence is held, strive with all their
energies to become worthy of the same distinction.
From this cause our buildings have
become the finest in the world&mdash;our works of
art have become the finest in the world&mdash;the
most wonderful discoveries exceed each other
in every branch of science&mdash;and in every department
of philosophy some new and amazing
effort of genius is continually making itself
manifest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a desirable state of things!&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do the people profit by their
generosity?&rdquo; inquired the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather say by their gratitude,&rdquo; observed
the stranger. &ldquo;Knowledge is imparted freely.
There are free lectures, in which our great men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
make public all the information that may most
enlighten a community; books are published
on every subject, and distributed freely to those
who require them; and their authors, having no
inclination ungratified, and finding their greatest
pleasure in diffusing the intelligence they possess,
employ their powers with nobler feelings
than in other nation the desire of money as
an object of reward, or a means of existence,
can under any circumstances create; and the
people, enjoying the wholesome pleasures thus
liberally conveyed to them, have neither inclination
nor time to contract vicious propensities,
and follow the daily business of life with
pure hearts, and minds open to every ennobling
impression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must enjoy an extraordinary amount
of happiness,&rdquo; observed Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With what is usually called misery they are
entirely ignorant,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;for
as all their time is employed in the right application
of the means of enjoyment, they create
no wrong; consequently they cannot produce
anything but happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Worthy Sophos!&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;In the streets through which we have passed,
although I have noticed every sort of warehouse
and shop for the purposes of trade, I
have not seen any place for the sale of intoxicating
liquors; and among all the public buildings
I have beheld, I have not met with any
thing which, from its appearance, I could consider
a prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Intoxicating liquors we neither buy nor
sell,&rdquo; replied Sophos. &ldquo;The pure beverage
which nature has provided so liberally for our
enjoyment, confers upon us both health and
pleasure; and although the indulgence of every
natural inclination is allowed, any intemperance
in the enjoyment of an appetite is punished
with immediate and general disgrace; the sensualist,
the glutton, or the drunkard is avoided
as unworthy to associate with his fellow men,
and the instances of such offences being committed
are so rare, that they are now looked
upon as altogether unnatural. As for prisons
we do not want them; we have no use for
them. Such offences as crimes against life, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
crimes against property; crimes against the individual,
or crimes against the state, are so few
that if we were to build a prison, we should find
some difficulty in getting in it a single inhabitant.
We have long known that prisons do not
prevent crime. We are aware that wherever
there have been the most prisons, there have
been the greatest number of criminals; and
beholding in the experience of ages the inutility
of punishment as a preventive to criminality,
we came to the conclusion, that the only sure
way of preventing a man becoming a criminal,
is to remove from his path all temptations to
crime. Every citizen having the free enjoyment
of every inclination, cannot possibly have
a want that interferes with the interests of the
community; and we are exceedingly careful
throughout the educational course of life to
prevent the existence of any inclination that
may be hurtful either to the individual or to
the society to which he belongs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this one of your religious edifices?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel, pointing to a large building
supported by elegant pillars, and having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
appearance of the highest degree of architectural
excellence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, and it is not,&rdquo; replied Sophos, with
a smile. &ldquo;It is a religious edifice, inasmuch
as it is well calculated to assist in establishing
religious impressions, and it is used for the purpose
of conveying moral instruction to the
hearts of those who enter its walls: and it is
not a religious edifice, because it is connected
with no mystery, and is no place for monks and
priests, grovelling superstitions, and unmeaning
ceremonies. But you shall examine the interior.&rdquo;
With these words he ordered the
carriage to be driven up to the gates, and the
party alighting, entered the edifice.</p>

<p>Having passed through lofty folding doors,
they were ushered along a vaulted hall of immense
extent and admirable proportions. It
was lighted from the top by windows that spread
around the whole circumference of the dome in
a series of circles, between which the roof was
supported by gigantic figures of white marble.
The walls were painted in fresco, with a variety
of subjects executed in the first style of art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and the object of every painting appeared to
be to elevate the human mind into a love of
practical benevolence. Nothing barbarous, nothing
cruel, nothing unjust, nothing coarse,
nothing that could create an unpleasant feeling,
had here been introduced; but all that was affectionate
and true, and pure and excellent,
had been seized by the plastic genius of the
artist, and fixed in undying colours upon the
wall.</p>

<p>In the different divisions that separated these
pictures appeared short moral maxims and
philosophical sentences. Every religion seemed
to have furnished some portion of the instruction
here conveyed. Near the truths of Christianity
might be observed the wisdom of Islamism;
the Proverbs of Solomon had a place by the
side of the maxims of Zoroaster, and the wisdom
of Confucius was inscribed opposite the
philosophy of Socrates. Wherever the eye
turned it caught something worthy of contemplation,
and whatever the mind contemplated
it found impressive, unanswerable, and impossible
to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What place do you call this?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel of his conductor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is called the Hall of Wisdom and of
Humanity,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;And here,
if the soul is fretted by pain or sorrow, or the
heart yearns for some refreshing influence, comes
the citizen from the busy toils of life, and gazing
on these tokens of a benevolent power, and
studying these signs of a comprehensive intelligence,
he finds that both his heart and mind
are strengthened&mdash;a love of excellence pervades
all his nature, and he passes back to the world
with a cheerful spirit, giving and partaking
gladness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are the principles of your religion?&rdquo;
asked Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The principles of our religion are the best
principles of every religion that has existed from
the creation of the world,&rdquo; responded Sophos.
&ldquo;We found every variety of faith could produce
something profitable. The worst religion
has brought forth good men, good women, and
good citizens, and surrounded by the most degrading
superstitions, we invariably found some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
truth worthy of general appreciation. We also
found that the most enlightened religions produced
bad men, bad women, and bad citizens,
and discovered amid the most wholesome truths
they endeavoured to inculcate, some pernicious
superstition that destroyed the efficacy of their
doctrines. This led to a consideration of their
separate natures, and upon careful examination
we discovered that from the earliest ages, all
people had been doing the same thing under
different names. They had personified two opposing
principles&mdash;the principle of good and
the principle of evil, which they had worshipped.
In many religious systems the machinery was
more complicated than in others, but all were
easily traced to the same source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The names of God and Devil,&rdquo; continued
Sophos, &ldquo;are so obviously modified from good
and evil, and the attributes of each power are
so completely the attributes of each principle,
that nothing more need be said of their connection.
They are the same things: as principles
they are the light and shadow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
moral world; as deities, the Alpha and Omega
of Christianity and Judaism. Vishnu the Preserver,
and Siva the Destroyer, the most important
members of the Hindoo Pantheon&mdash;the
Ahrimanes and Ormuzd of Zoroaster, and the
Fire Worshippers of Persia&mdash;the Osiris and
Typhon of the Egyptians&mdash;the Jupiter and
Pluto of the Greeks&mdash;and the great idols of
every form of worship that had at any time of
the world existed, are but personifications of
the opposing principles good and evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked
Doctor Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe anything of the kind,&rdquo;
observed Fortyfolios: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s heathenish, abominable,
and atheistical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having made this analysis,&rdquo; continued the
stranger, without attending to the interruptions
he had received, &ldquo;we came to the determination
of making these principles our form of
faith; that is to say, we made our doctrines
those of benevolence. Good was our God&mdash;Philanthropy
was our religion; and doing good
became the way in which we endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
worship the Deity. The good principle is
around us at all times while we live, and
creates our felicity, and produces the pleasures
of those around us; and death is the
evil principle, which puts an end to the happiness
we were enjoying and creating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your form of government?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our supreme head is called the Optimus,
or the Best,&rdquo; replied Sophos. &ldquo;He is addressed
by the title of our Benefactor the Optimus,
and is elevated to that dignity in consequence
of his having distinguished himself above his
fellow-citizens by the superior excellence of his
wisdom and greatness of his philanthropy. He
is assisted in the duties of the government by
an assembly of two hundred of the most experienced,
the wisest, and the best of his fellow-countrymen,
who are called Fathers; and from
this assembly the people always choose their
Optimus, who reigns as long as his faculties
permit him to exercise his judgment for the
benefit of the people, and his reign is called
his Optimate. Inferior in dignity to the assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of Fathers, is a parliament of five
hundred, who are distinguished by the name
of Brothers; and they represent the interests
of certain communities or disciples into which
our great family is divided. It must not be
imagined from these divisions and distinctions
that there are any exclusive advantages or
separate interests amongst us. Any individual
may obtain the highest offices of the legislature
by passing through the parliament of Brothers
and the assembly of Fathers, for which he must
show himself well qualified by knowledge,
virtue, and benevolence. He gains neither
advantage nor profit&mdash;nothing but the esteem
of his fellow-citizens; and the people are
classed into distinct communities of disciples,
merely that the interests of the whole shall
receive a proper degree of attention from the
legislative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you find such a form of government
answer the purpose for which it was
designed?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; replied Sophos. &ldquo;The laws are
simple and few, and admirably adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
satisfy the wants of the people. We have no
monopolies to protect; we have no exclusive
privileges to confer. There is no legislative
enactment passed which does not take into
consideration the happiness of each and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to observe with how few
laws a nation may be governed,&rdquo; said the
doctor; &ldquo;and it is equally surprising to notice
with how many laws a nation may be misgoverned,
don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let us enter the Hall of Public Benefactors,&rdquo;
said the stranger; and passing through
a succession of elegant arches, he led the way
to another magnificent hall, similar in grandeur
and beauty to the one they had recently left.
Statues, rather larger than life, were placed in
separate niches round the wall; and these
statues represented individuals who had rendered
themselves illustrious by their virtues or
intelligence. In one place stood the figure of
the immortal Howard; in another that of the
admirable Pestalozzi. Opposite these philanthropists
were the patriots Alfred, Leonidas,
Sobieski, William Tell, and Hofer. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
stood the impetuous Körner, and there the
amiable Shelley. Jeremy Bentham, Oberlin,
Owen of Lanark, Sir Samuel Romilly, and
Wilberforce had places near Harvey, the discoverer
of the circulation, Galileo, Fenelon,
Plato, Socrates, Newton, Bacon, and La Place;
and Tasso, and Petrarch, and Göthe, and
Walter Scott, and Coleridge, and Wordsworth,
were seen by the side of Shakspeare, and
Milton, and Cicero, and Demosthenes, and
Aristotle, and Plutarch. The most commanding
intellects, the noblest natures, the wisest,
the best, and kindest of human beings were
here all represented in the plastic marble, and
raised high above the heads of those who were
gazing upon them, as if to show how elevated
were such spirits above the common mass of
mankind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra to his
patron, with his eyes shining with pleasure,
pointing to a statue that was placed in one of
the most conspicuous situations in the chamber.
Oriel looked in the required direction, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
with a delight that kept him dumb, recognised
the statue of his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the statue of your father has been
considered worthy of a place in the Hall of
Public Benefactors,&rdquo; observed Sophos; &ldquo;and
even here, in that nobleness of heart which all
good men should honour, he will scarcely meet
with a superior. Master Porphyry has deserved
well of the world, and the world should honour
him above the ambitious crowd who strive for
their notice. He has made of his great wealth
a great blessing. He has been a doer of good
from his youth upward; and the love which he
has evinced for his fellow-creatures has been
universal in its object. Had he been born
amongst us, or were his virtues transplanted
into our society, I have no doubt that upon the
first occasion he would be promoted to the
rank of Optimus; but whether in Athenia or
in Columbus, or in whatever part of the world
he may chance to be, there he will be The
Best, and there he will have sovereignty over
all good men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry listened with feelings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
most exquisite pleasure to this eulogium, and
he gazed, with a happiness in his eyes it was
long since he had experienced, upon the marble
figure which had been sculptured into a resemblance
of his parent; but the delight of Zabra
seemed still more intense, and he turned from
the statue to his friend, and from his friend to
the statue, as if he never could be tired of
gazing upon their noble countenances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is here our great and good men come
and meditate,&rdquo; continued the stranger; &ldquo;and,
gazing upon the greatness and goodness they
see around them, standing in their places of
honour, an impulse of emulation fills their
souls, their hearts are brimming over with
generous sympathies, and they return to the
senate or the public hall with eloquence that
carries conviction to the hearer, and a purpose
that can only be satisfied by the production of
some general and lasting benefit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party proceeded into other halls, some
for public instruction, others for social intercourse,
and others for the deliberations of the
legislature, and in all they observed the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
happy adaptation of the means to the end, the
same beautiful appearances, the same spirit
of benevolence, and the same admirable harmony
in the disposition of the different parts
of the chamber, as they had noticed in the
chambers through which they had passed.
After which they resumed their ride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I have seen in my travels
that has afforded me so much pleasure as what
I have observed during the brief stay I have
made in this city;&rdquo; observed the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as yet you have seen scarcely any thing
of us, of our manners, or of our institutions;&rdquo;
replied Sophos. &ldquo;Let me now take you to a
musical entertainment given in the open air by
an orchestra of at least a thousand performers,
and it will give you an opportunity of not only
hearing the best music performed in the most
expressive manner, but of mingling with the
people of Athenia in their hours of relaxation
and amusement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Permission having been readily granted, the
carriage was driven off to an open park, beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
planted with noble trees and flowering
plants, (amongst which carriage ways and footpaths
wound in graceful sweeps), and possessing
every variety of hill and dale, lake and
rivulet to increase its attractions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is one of the public parks that have
been planted to secure the health and improve
the pleasures of the citizens;&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;Here you see are thronging the young and
the old, the philosopher and the student,
the statesman and the mechanic, all with
happy faces, and each intent that his neighbour
shall share in his happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are yonder group of beautiful
girls that seem so much delighted with one another.
It is strange that they should appear in a
public place without some male friends or relations;&rdquo;
observed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all;&rdquo; replied Sophos. &ldquo;Who can
look upon them without respect? They want
no protectors, for there is here no one who
would even think them harm. They are probably
proceeding to the concert for the purpose
of joining in the choruses, and are the daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the noblest of our citizens. We have made
music a part of our system of education, and
not unwisely; for there is no source of gratification
so capable of refining and intellectualising
the feelings. Each individual possesses the
power of distributing pleasure to the rest, and
here, when they can escape from the necessary
labours of life, come all,&mdash;from the humblest
to the highest, from the most ignorant to the
most enlightened, and tuning their instruments
and their voices into one grand harmonious
concert, they create such a powerful and delicious
music as I should imagine it would be
impossible to excel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party had now arrived at the top of a
hill, from which they had a splendid view of
the scene before them. Down to the very base
of the hill on which they stood, at least twenty
thousand citizens, men, women, and children,
clad in a costume, varying in some degree from
that worn by Sophos, were reclining on the
grass. Opposite to them was a hill of smaller
dimensions, upon which an immense orchestra
was being arranged. At the top, on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
side, were a pair of gigantic drums, between
which were several smaller ones. Below these
were the brass instruments, then the flutes,
bassoons, oboes and clarionets: the double
basses and violincellos flanked the violins, and
outside the stringed instruments, the choruses
were stationed; a place was left at bottom for
the principal singers, in the centre of which
stood the conductor, ready to give the time of
the performance.</p>

<p>The spectators had hitherto carried on a conversation
each in his own circle; but immediately
the conductor&rsquo;s bâton was seen in motion,
every one was in an attitude of attention, and
then among the whole mass of listeners not a
sound arose. The first piece performed was
for instruments only. It commenced with a
movement remarkable for the solemnity of its
character and the richness of its harmonies,
which changed into a sweet and graceful subject
in quicker time, wherein several beautiful
phrases were worked up by the musician in a
variety of pleasing shapes. The piece ended
with a more lively movement, introducing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
magnificent fugue, in which the different instruments
followed each other with an effect astonishing
for its grandeur and beauty. To say
it was well played, would convey only a feeble
conception of the excellence of the performance:
it was played with that perfect precision, and
exquisite attention to the expression required
in the composition, which can only characterise
the very best performances. As soon as it was
over there arose from the delighted multitude
who thronged the hill a loud and continued
burst of applause, mingled with exclamations
expressive of the approbation of the listeners,
and every one seemed to turn to his neighbour
to observe if he was as well gratified as himself.</p>

<p>A song, or rather descriptive scene for a bass
voice, with orchestral accompaniments, followed,
in which the poet and musician sought to describe
the temptations to evil, its committal,
and its evil consequences; and the piece ended
with a most harrowing picture of madness and
death. After this there was a dramatic duet
between a treble and tenor, delineating the
first appearance and confession of a mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
affection. This was succeeded by a vocal air
for a female voice, marked by a simple and exquisite
pathos that seemed to touch every heart;
and its subject was the despair of the heart,
when, having for a long time believed itself beloved,
it awakes to the full conviction that it is
deceived. A grand chorus in praise of nature
followed; and the effect of so many hundred
voices swelling out the harmonies, was grand
in the extreme; and the act concluded by a
descriptive symphony for the orchestra, full of
sweet pastoral effect, and admirable instrumentation.</p>

<p>Each composition was performed in a manner
as nearly approaching perfection as was attainable,
and this the audience seemed to acknowledge
by the liberality of their plaudits. Upon
Zabra the effect seemed to be extraordinary.
He drank in every sound as if his life depended
upon its enjoyment, and he listened with a
sense of pleasure beaming in his features that
nothing but the most intense gratification could
have created. The rest of the performance was
of a similar degree of merit, and the party left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the hill impressed with the conviction that they
had seen and enjoyed more rational pleasure
than they had ever known at any public place
of amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have missed the exquisite
delight I have received, on any consideration;&rdquo;
remarked Zabra. &ldquo;Enraptured as I am with
music, I have known nothing in my experience
that bears a comparison with the enjoyments of
this day. And what could create more pleasure?
It would be sufficient, one would suppose, to
be made familiar with the skill of ordinary
musicians; but you could take no interest in
their performances, they are drilled to do them,
and they can do nothing else: but here is a
multitudinous family of musicians, hastening from
the loom, the study, the workshop, the laboratory
and the warehouse, who each has a
distinct business to which he must devote his
attention, to join, from a desire to please his
fellow-citizens, in the execution of the most
difficult and beautiful productions of the musical
art; and every one takes his part, caring
not, however unimportant it may be, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
is allowed to share in producing the general
happiness. Of all the arts of civilised life there
can be none so humanising in its tendency, so
refreshing in its influence; so pure, exalting,
and subduing in its effects as music. The man
who is insensible to its charms is afflicted with
a most pitiable blindness. There can be no
harmony in his nature. His feelings must be
in an unchangeable state of discord. But point
out any human creature sensitive to all musical
impressions, and I would affirm that you might
mould him into any good purpose. Music, as
a means of educating the feelings, can never be
excelled. The experience of a hundred ages
has proved its power as an instrument for
creating or subduing the passions; and yet never
till now have I seen any attempt made to try
its beneficial effects on a large scale, and by
making good musicians, to endeavour to create
good men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time for a reply to be made to
these observations, as the carriage stopped at
the door of a handsome mansion, and the party
prepared to alight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must introduce you into our social circle,&rdquo;
said Sophos, as he led the way into his
dwelling; &ldquo;and I hope you will be able to
find in it the same happiness that I have so
long enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed him through several apartments
furnished with superior taste, till they
entered a room of more moderate proportions
ornamented with a variety of elegant decorations,
in which two females were reclining on
an ottoman, with a handsome youth standing
before them reading from an open book. The
females were the wife and daughter of their
host; and both possessed countenances of exceeding
beauty: the maternal dignity of the
one contrasting admirably with the affectionate
playfulness of the other; and the youth was
the betrothed of the daughter. As soon as
Sophos entered they hastened to meet him,
and welcomed him with their endearments.
These being over he introduced his guests to
their notice, who received from them such
marks of kindness and attention as made them
instantly at ease. After an interesting conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
describing what had been witnessed
during their morning&rsquo;s ride, the party were
summoned to the dining-room, where they
partook of wholesome food of exquisite flavour,
served up without ostentation or extravagance,
and partaken of without epicureanism
or gluttony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zoe,&rdquo; said Sophos to his daughter, &ldquo;has
nothing transpired since my absence that is
worthy of recital?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to communicate to you,
my father,&rdquo; replied the beautiful girl, as she
pushed back from her eyes the dark ringlets
that seemed to have fallen from the little velvet
cap embroidered with gold which was worn
tight upon the upper part of her head; &ldquo;but
I know not whether it would interest your
guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will excuse you, Zoe, if it should not,&rdquo;
observed the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had gone to perform my customary duties,
as nurse, at the Hospital of Invalids,&rdquo; said
Zoe, &ldquo;when my attentions were required by a
youth who was in a state of intense delirium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
He raved, he shouted and wept; he entreated
with all the eloquence of frantic excitement;
and then upbraided with the unsocial energy
of despair: but most conspicuous in all his
ravings was the name of Lusa, which appeared
to belong to some maiden by whom he was
enamoured, who did not return his attachment.
In his delirium he mistook me for the object
of his passion, and by turns praised me as the
kindest of all created beings, and upbraided me
as the most cruel of my sex. To such an extent
did these paroxysms arrive, that, unless
some plan was put into operation which would
lessen the excitement under which he laboured,
there appeared no hopes of saving his life. I
knew nothing of him or of his history; and I
knew as little of Lusa and of the cause which
prevented their mutual happiness; but there
was no doubt that the indifference of the
maiden had created the malady which threatened
the youth&rsquo;s life; and I felt convinced,
that if I could make him imagine that a mutual
sympathy existed, a healthy action would
ensue, and a recovery follow. Being addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
as Lusa, I thought it would be advisable, under
the character thus imposed upon me, to give
the sufferer hopes of a more blissful termination
to his affections; and, therefore, I cautiously
and kindly made him imagine that the
heart he thought so unrelenting had been subdued
by a wish to alleviate his sufferings.
You will pardon me this deception, dear father,
as it was done to save a life which might
be made valuable to the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was nothing wrong in it, Zoe; and
these are deceptions that not only become necessary,
but are not to be avoided without
inhumanity,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The youth listened to me as if there was
the power of life and death upon my lips,&rdquo; continued
Zoe; &ldquo;every word seemed to sink into his
heart: his frenzy became subdued; the feverish
fire fled from his eyes&mdash;he grew calm, and
blessed me with a fervour impossible to be
described. After this he fell into a profound
sleep. Then I found myself placed in a difficult
and distressing position. I knew, that when
he woke, he would discover the deception that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
had been practised upon him, and I feared that
the result would be a relapse, from which there
could be no recovery. While I was vainly endeavouring
to conceive some plan by which I
might escape from the embarrassing situation
in which I was placed, a young and handsome
female entered that portion of the hospital in
which my duties were performed. She approached
me, and inquired after the health of
the patient committed to my charge. She did
not tell me who she was, and I imagined her to
be a relative. I therefore acquainted her with
the exact state of the case; and related the way
in which I had discovered the origin of his
malady. I described to her the distressing
situation in which I had placed myself by the
deception I had practised, as I knew, that on
his awaking, he must discover how cruelly he
had been imposed upon. I had noticed during
my recital that the maiden had appeared confused,
had looked distressed, anxious, and full
of sympathy for the sufferer; but I was not prepared
for the avowal she made when I had told
her all I had to communicate. She was Lusa.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you manage to arrange the
matter, my Zoe?&rdquo; inquired Sophos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I immediately made an appeal to her sympathies,&rdquo;
replied his daughter. &ldquo;I described to
her the positive danger in which the youth was
placed by her indifference&mdash;and endeavoured
to awaken her feelings to a sense of the pleasures
she would be storing for herself if she resolved
upon rescuing him from the perils by which he
was threatened. She replied that he was
amiable and good, and had given her no cause
for her apparent unkindness; but that she had
not loved him in return for his affections, because
he had excited in her no similar feeling;
and, that hearing of his danger, her heart had
been filled with tenderness, and that she had
come to the hospital for the express purpose of
endeavouring to tranquillise his mind with happier
thoughts. This confession rejoiced me
more than I can possibly express; and I bade
her take my place at his bedside, while I
remained at a distance to notice the effect her
appearance would have upon him when he awoke.
I had not waited long before I observed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
head move on the pillow. His eyes looked
clearer&mdash;his countenance calm and intelligent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it a dream?&rsquo; he said, as his gaze wandering
round fell upon the blushing face of his
Lusa. The look with which she answered the
question seemed to have subdued him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lusa!&rsquo; he murmured, as he gazed upon
her with a kindling eye and quivering lip.
&lsquo;Lusa, my beloved! My soul is on my lips&mdash;let
me bless you! My hope, my guide, my
consolation! the very breath of my being&mdash;the
aim and glory of my dreams! in all earnestness,
in all sincerity, and in all love, I bless you; and
may the blessing I confer remain upon you,
gladden the atmosphere you breathe, and fill
with beauty every scene upon which you gaze!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lusa&rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears; and
bending her head down to his face, her lips
rested upon his. She then moved away her
head to conceal her tears; and, taking his hand
in hers, she talked to him of hope and happiness;
and assured him that she would endeavour to
return the affection he had lavished on her so
liberally. To this he made no reply. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
looked upon his face and saw that his eyes were
fixed and glassy. A scream brought me to her
side; and, gazing in fear and pity, we discovered
that he was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died happy,&rdquo; observed Sophos, &ldquo;and
his life had been blameless: there is nothing
dreadful in such a dissolution. I should say
that, under such circumstances, Death was
robbed of all his terrors. The heart of the
affectionate youth was too full; he died of excessive
happiness; his breath passed away in
a blessing, and his soul took flight in a caress.
Is there any other way of passing from existence
which, to a lover, could afford so much
and so true an enjoyment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; here remarked Zoe&rsquo;s
betrothed. &ldquo;It appeared as if all the happiness
of his existence had been concentrated into
one moment, and that its intensity destroyed
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was young,&rdquo; said the matron; &ldquo;and in
youth, when the soul is attached to one object,
though there be no return to the passion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
no hope except what the lover creates, he will
love the more, the more despairing becomes his
attachment. As the individual acquires experience,
he loves more wisely; or, perhaps, I
might say, he becomes more selfish: he thinks of
himself much more than his passion; and an
instance of devotion without a return is rarely,
if ever, met with beyond the period of youth.
Manhood is prouder&mdash;age more cautious; and
as life passes on, the impulses which might
have been wakened by a breath are not to be
stirred even by a whirlwind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whence go you when you leave our
shores?&rdquo; inquired Sophos of the young merchant,
as if desirous of changing the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pass from here to Constantinople; and
from there, after touching at some of the principal
ports in Europe, I intend visiting the
classic shores of England;&rdquo; replied Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an interesting voyage,&rdquo; observed his
host; &ldquo;especially your intended visit to the
English shores: it is an ancient country, and
to the philanthropist is connected with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
associations that make it regarded with peculiar
interest. The brightest page in her book of
honour records the efforts she made to extinguish
the slave trade throughout the world.
It was a great boast of the Englishmen of those
days, that a slave, as soon as he set his foot
upon the honoured land of England, became a
free man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at the efforts it made for the
regeneration of every other country;&rdquo; added
Fortyfolios. &ldquo;For how long a period did it
take the lead in civilisation! Its learning
enriched the whole world; its manufactures
produced clothing for almost every people by
whom clothing was required; and its mechanical
improvements conferred wealth and
power on every nation that adopted them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the picture to be true to nature requires
a little shadow, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; observed
the doctor. &ldquo;There are some accounts of
cruelty, and oppression, and bigotry, which
ought to find a place in their history. We
must not forget the manner in which they
acquired their possessions in India; the tyranny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and slaughter they introduced among the natives
of Southern Africa; the infamous system of
slavery they encouraged in the West Indies;
and the destructive and unjust warfare they
waged with their colonists in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although I cannot defend the manner in
which the English acquired new territory
abroad,&rdquo; said the professor; &ldquo;when I compare
it with the more savage policy of the Spaniards,
the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and
other nations who endeavoured to add to their
possessions by conquering distant lands and
massacring the natives, I think England comparatively
blameless. Their behaviour to the
Africans in the interior of the Cape of Good
Hope was produced by the colonists they found
there, not by the colonists they introduced
there; the evils of West Indian slavery ought
to be forgotten in consideration of their constant
efforts to ameliorate the conditions of
their own slaves, and the great sacrifices they
made to put down slavery in every part of the
world; and their treatment of their colonists
in America should only be remembered as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
cause&mdash;the glorious cause&mdash;which created one
of the most important empires that ever existed
upon the face of the globe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are certainly a few blots upon the
fame of this great people,&rdquo; remarked Sophos;
&ldquo;but the good they effected&mdash;a good which is
enjoyed by every portion of the civilised world
at this moment&mdash;was attempted on so grand a
scale, and produced such magnificent results,
that, in justice, we ought not to look too narrowly
upon their errors. And now, Zoe, as
the strangers are about to visit the shores of
England, endeavour to delight them, as you
have done me, with that ancient song which
appears to be so great a favourite of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, O my father, if you will ask Alcibiades
to join me; for it is more fit for his voice
than for mine;&rdquo; replied Zoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alcibiades does not require an invitation,
dear Zoe, for so delightful a purpose;&rdquo; said the
youth, looking all that his words expressed.</p>

<p>With rich harmonious voices that blended
together with exquisite effect, and with a
manner so expressive that it stirred the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of those around them to feelings of the most
intense gratification, the two commenced the
following song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Hurra for merry England, the island of the blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where gen&rsquo;rous thoughts, and loving hopes, are nursed in ev&rsquo;ry breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where valleys green, and mountains high, and rivers strong and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are fill&rsquo;d with blissful memories Time cannot set to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurra for merry England! Confusion on her foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladness shine upon her homes&mdash;for merry England ho!<br /></span>

<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Hurra for mighty England! the island of the brave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose conquering flag hath waved its pride o&rsquo;er ev&rsquo;ry shore and wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From eastern hills arose the sun, he kiss&rsquo;d the western streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he found that English swords were flashing in his beams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurra for mighty England! Destruction on her foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And triumph dwell within her hearts&mdash;for mighty England ho!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where coward souls and slavish minds were never known to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, proudly as they look&rsquo;d upon their own unfetter&rsquo;d gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave other lands their bravery, and dash&rsquo;d away their chains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurra for noble England! Dishonour on her foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glory rest upon her lands&mdash;for noble England ho!&rdquo;<br /></span>
